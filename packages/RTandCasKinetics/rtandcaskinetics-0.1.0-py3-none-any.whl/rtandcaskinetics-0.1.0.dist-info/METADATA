# RTandCasKinetics
This is a tool that is used for creating a plot that investigates the combined kinetics of HIV reverse transcriptase

# Installation
To install, first install `pdm`, and make sure it's accessible in your $PATH
Prepare the local python environment by running `pdm install`

# Getting Started
To run this, go to the root directory `RTandCasKinetics/` and run the command `pdm run src/casmodel.py`
