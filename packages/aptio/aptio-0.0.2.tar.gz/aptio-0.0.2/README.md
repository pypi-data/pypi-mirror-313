# Aptio

A modern Python package manager GUI and CLI tool. stay tuned for updates!

The name Aptio is derived from the Latin word _aptus_, meaning "fit" or "suitable," reflecting its goal to provide a streamlined and adaptable solution for Python package management. It is pronounced **"ap-tee-oh"**.

## Rationale

Modern Python development often involves juggling multiple tools and dependencies to set up even the simplest project. For instance, installing essential build tools like `setuptools`, `twine`, and `build`, alongside a basic developer experience (DevEx) stack such as `black`, `bandit`, `pylint`, and `pytest`, can result in a requirements.txt file with over 50 packages due to transitive dependencies.

In such cases, it becomes nearly impossible to determine which dependencies were explicitly installed and which were pulled in as subdependencies. This lack of visibility creates challenges in managing, updating, and auditing project dependencies, particularly in environments with strict security or compliance requirements.

Aptio aims to simplify and modernize Python package management by providing tools for clear dependency visualization, streamlined installation, and proactive monitoring. With a graphical and CLI-based approach, Aptio empowers developers to maintain control over their Python environments, ensuring transparency and efficiency at every stage of development.
