    This function compares two adjacency matrices and returns a change matrix that shows the topological differences between the two graphs. The change matrix is a matrix where each element represents the change in the edge between two nodes. The change matrix is defined as follows:

    - 1: Edge in the first graph, not in the second
    - 2: Edge in the second graph, not in the first
    - 3: Edge in both graphs
