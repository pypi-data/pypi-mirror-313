Python library I’ve developed, featuring 100+ custom mathematical operations designed for diverse computational needs. This library offers a comprehensive suite of functions, including:

✅ Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, power, and more.
✅ Geometric Calculations: Areas, perimeters, and volumes of various shapes.
✅ Logical and Bitwise Operations: AND, OR, XOR, and shift operations.
✅ Statistical Functions: Mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
✅ Number Properties: Prime checks, even/odd checks, digit counts, and more.
✅ Custom Implementations: Square roots, cube roots, and factorials without using external libraries.
