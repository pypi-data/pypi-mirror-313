# About

## Simple

This library aims to be the simplest, easiest to use (and debug) functional programming library. No complex return types, no weird, base classes. No classes at all actually!

## Approach

We depend greatly on Python's standard library, especially partial, to give the feeling of currying while not sacrificing performance, or generating (hopefully) too much complexity. The general approach taken is to just wrap the imperative code so that usage can be more composable.

## Type Annotation

Type parameters are used where possible, though you're on your own if you're using dictionaries...

## Credit Where Credit is Due

Inspired by the Ramda.js library.
