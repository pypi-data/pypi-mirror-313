# Lightweight File Storage Service (LFSS)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/lfss)](https://pypi.org/project/lfss/)

My experiment on a lightweight and high-performance file/object storage service...  

**Highlights:**

- User storage limit and access control.
- Pagination and sorted file listing for vast number of files.  
- High performance: high concurrency, near-native speed on stress tests.
- Support range requests, so you can stream large files / resume download.

It stores small files and metadata in sqlite, large files in the filesystem.  
Tested on 2 million files, and it is still fast.

Usage: 
```sh
pip install lfss
lfss-user add <username> <password>
lfss-serve
```

By default, the data will be stored in `.storage_data`. 
You can change storage directory using the `LFSS_DATA` environment variable.

I provide a simple client to interact with the service: 
```sh
lfss-panel --open
```
Or, you can start a web server at `/frontend` and open `index.html` in your browser. 

The API usage is simple, just `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` to the `/<username>/file/url` path.  
Authentication via `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer <token>`, or through the `token` query parameter.  
You can refer to `frontend` as an application example, `lfss/api/connector.py` for more APIs. 

By default, the service exposes all files to the public for `GET` requests, 
but file-listing is restricted to the user's own files.  
Please refer to [docs/Permission.md](./docs/Permission.md) for more details on the permission system.
