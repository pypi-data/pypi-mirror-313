# F²AT Helpers

F²AT is a nonlinear three-dimensional Finite Element Method (FEM) tool developed for the efficient analysis of cylindrical foundations, including piles, monopile foundations, and suction piles. Its has the advantagees of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, and particular technical consideration towards the design of offshore wind turbine (OWT) foundations.

F²AT has the following key features:

The F²AT program is a 3D FEM program, featured by Fourier series aided FE theory and particularly defined 'ring' elements.
The F²AT program employs various material models to simulate the complex soil behaviour, e.g. non-linearity, anisotropy and damping.

F²AT runs in the cloud on DNV's OneCompute platform. This package enables calculations to be run without the end user needing to understand the OneCompute platform.

## Documentation
The [F²AT User Documentation](https://myworkspace-dev.dnv.com/download/sesam/Infidep/downloads/docs/index.html) contains more details about INFIDEP, including the input data format.

## Examples
Python examples are available in the [F²AT Examples](https://github.com/dnvgl/f2at-examples) repository.
