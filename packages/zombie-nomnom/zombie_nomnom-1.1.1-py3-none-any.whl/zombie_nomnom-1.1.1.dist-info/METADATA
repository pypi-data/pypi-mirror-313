This is a game engine that is modeled after the popular board game zombie dice. This is meant for practice to be able to be messed with and explored.

Installation
---

`pip install zombie_nomnom`


We require at least python 3.10 to be able to run properly.


Usage
---

You can use the zombie_nomnom engine directly in code like this:

```python
...
from zombie_nomnom import ZombieDieGame, DrawDice, Score

draw_three = DrawDice(3)
score_hand = Score()
game = ZombieDieGame(players=["Player One", "Player Two])

logger.info(game.round)

result = game.process_command(draw_three)
logger.info(result)

result = game.process_command(score_hand)
logger.info(result)

loger.info(game.round)
# ... keep playing game below
```

Or you can play it using the CLI that is already baked into the package:

```bash
> zombie-nomnom cli
Enter Player Name: Jeffery
Add Another Player? [y/N]: 
Players: Jeffery (0)
Currently Playing Jeffery, Hand: Brains(0), Feet(0), Shots(0), Dice Remaining: 13
0) Exit
1) Draw dice
2) Score hand
Select Item (0-2): 1
```
