# rerun-robotics

Utilities to use the amazing [Rerun visualizer](https://www.rerun.io/) for robotics applications.
This repo is a work in progress.

## Installation

```bash
pip install rerun-robotics
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/williamshen-nz/rerun-robotics.git
cd rerun-robotics
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Check the [Rerun documentation](https://www.rerun.io/docs) for information on how to use the viewer.

We currently support the Franka Emika Panda robot and setting it via joint positions.

```python
import rerun as rr
from rerun_robotics import load_franka_panda

rr.init("demo", spawn=True)

panda = load_franka_panda()
# 7 arm joints + 1 gripper joint
panda.set_joint_positions([0, -0.75, 0, -2.35, 0, 1.57, 0.78, 0.04])
```

### Franka Panda Demo

This demo shows how to log joint positions over time using a [timeline](https://rerun.io/docs/concepts/timelines).

```bash
python -m rerun_robotics.examples.panda
```

[Source code](rerun_robotics/examples/panda.py)

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues, try to install the most recent version of the rerun-sdk (`pip install rerun-sdk -U`). The APIs
are mostly stable but still change sometimes. If you still are unable to get things working, please open an issue and we
will do our best to help!

Last tested on `rerun-sdk==0.17.0`.

## Changelog

See [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md).
