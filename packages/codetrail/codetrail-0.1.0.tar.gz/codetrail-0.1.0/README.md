## 🤔 What's This All About?

Welcome to the learning experience! First things first: `Codetrail` is not trying to be the next `Git`. Heck, we're actually using `Git` as our version control system. We're just crazy enough to build our own distributed version control system from scratch because... why not?

## 💡 The Mission

We're here to prove that with:

- A dangerous amount of curiosity
- Caffeine (lots of it)
- Sheer, unadulterated determination
- And perhaps a slight dash of madness

You can build a distributed version control system from the ground up. Is it practical? Probably not. Is it educational? Absolutely! Will it be fun? You bet your last semicolon it will be!

## 🗺️ Roadmap (Or: How We're Building This Thing)

### Phase 1: Baby Steps 🐣

- [x] Project setup (You're looking at it!)
- [ ] `init` - Because every journey needs a starting point
- [ ] `config` - Local config only (we're keeping it simple, folks)
- [ ] `add` - Teaching `codetrail` which files to track
- [ ] `commit` - Making our first memories together

### Phase 2: Walking Steadily 🚶

- [ ] `status` - Finding out what's going on
- [ ] `log` - A trip down memory lane
- [ ] `branch` - Because sometimes we need parallel universes
- [ ] `checkout` - Time travel between branches

### Phase 3: Starting to Run 🏃

- [ ] `merge` - Bringing parallel universes together
- [ ] `reset` - For when we mess up (it happens)
- [ ] `revert` - For when we mess up but want to be fancy about fixing it
- [ ] Basic conflict resolution (pray we don't need this)

### Future Dreams 💭

- [ ] Remote repository support
- [ ] Push/pull mechanisms
- [ ] Interactive rebase (because we're ambitious)
- [ ] Whatever cool feature you suggest!

## 🎯 What Makes Codetrail Different?

Unlike other VCS projects that try to compete with Git, we're here to:

- Learn how Git's magic actually works
- Break things (intentionally, of course)
- Fix those things (eventually)
- Document every "aha!" and "oh no!" moment
- Share the journey with fellow code adventurers

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# TODO!
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a bug? That's probably a feature! But if you insist, feel free to:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Open a Pull Request
6. Wait for us to figure out how Pull Requests work in our own system

## ⚠️ Warning

If you're looking for a production-ready VCS, you might want to stick with Git. If you're looking for an adventure in code that might occasionally explode in your face (in a good way), you're in the right place!
