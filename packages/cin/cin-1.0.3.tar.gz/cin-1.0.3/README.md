# Collective Intelligence Network

Collective Intelligence Network (CIN) is an idea to create autonomous agents that have their dynamic workflows


## Framework Purpose & Vision

This framework was designed with three core principles in mind: simplicity, flexibility, and interoperability. My goal was to create a platform where autonomous agents can effectively tackle complex challenges either collabortively or individually, while meeting enterprise-grade requirements.
