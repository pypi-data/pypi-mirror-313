   - Reduced Python object overhead through C-level data structures
   - Optimized string operations for transaction details

2. **Computational efficiency**
   - Static typing eliminates dynamic dispatch overhead
   - Direct C-level attribute access without Python dictionary lookups
   - Minimal Python API interaction for core operations

### Implementation details

#### Transaction class architecture
The core `Transaction` class is implemented in Cython with the following specifications:

```python
cdef class Transaction:
    cdef str sender      # Static typing for sender attribute
    cdef str receiver    # Static typing for receiver attribute
    cdef float amount    # Static typing for amount attribute
```

Key characteristics:
- C-level attribute declarations for optimal memory access
- Direct attribute manipulation without Python's attribute dictionary
- Optimized string handling for transaction details

## Mathematical models and foundation of `Bitcoin-Lite` transaction system

### 1. Transaction model

#### 1.1 Basic transaction representation
A transaction `T` can be represented as a tuple:
```
T = (s, r, a, t)
```
where:
- s ∈ A (sender address space)
- r ∈ A (receiver address space)
- a ∈ ℝ+ (positive real numbers for amount)
- t ∈ ℤ+ (timestamp in epoch)

#### 1.2 Balance calculation
For any address `x`, the balance `B(x)` at time `t` is defined as:

```math
B(x,t) = ∑[T∈L | T.r=x] T.a - ∑[T∈L | T.s=x] T.a
```

where `L` is the set of all confirmed transactions in the ledger before time t.

#### 1.3 Transaction validity function
A transaction validity function `V(T)` is defined as:

```math
V(T) = {
    1, if B(T.s,T.t) ≥ T.a
    0, otherwise
}
```

### 2. Performance analysis

#### 2.1 Time complexity
The time complexity for key operations:

1. Transaction Creation: O(1)
2. Balance Calculation: O(n), where `n` is the number of transactions
3. Transaction Validation: O(n)

#### 2.2 Space Complexity
The space complexity `S(n)` for n transactions:

```math
S(n) = St + n(Ss + Sr + Sa + Sh)
```
where:
- St: Transaction overhead
- Ss: Sender address size
- Sr: Receiver address size
- Sa: Amount size
- Sh: Hash size

### 3. Optimization metrics

#### 3.1 Performance ratio
The performance ratio `R` comparing Cython implementation to pure Python:

```math
R = Tp/Tc
```
where:
- Tp: Execution time in pure Python
- Tc: Execution time in Cython

#### 3.2 Memory efficiency
Memory efficiency `E` is calculated as:

```math
E = (Mp - Mc)/Mp * 100%
```
where:
- Mp: Memory usage in pure Python
- Mc: Memory usage in Cython

### 4. Statistical analysis

#### 4.1 Transaction distribution
For `n` transactions, the probability density function `f(x)` of transaction amounts:

```math
f(x) = (1/nσ√(2π)) * e^(-(x-μ)²/2σ²)
```
where:
- μ: Mean transaction amount
- σ: Standard deviation of amounts

#### 4.2 Network load model
The network load `L(t)` at time `t`:

```math
L(t) = λ + ∑(i=1 to n) αᵢe^(-β(t-tᵢ))
```
where:
- λ: Base load
- α: Transaction weight
- β: Decay factor
- tᵢ: Transaction time

### 5. Implementation examples

#### 5.1 Balance calculation implementation
```python
def calculate_balance(address, transactions):
    received = sum(t.amount for t in transactions if t.receiver == address)
    sent = sum(t.amount for t in transactions if t.sender == address)
    return received - sent
```

#### 5.2 Transaction validation
```python
def validate_transaction(transaction, ledger):
    sender_balance = calculate_balance(transaction.sender, ledger)
    return sender_balance >= transaction.amount
```

### 6. Practical applications

#### 6.1 Load testing formula
System capacity C can be calculated as:

```math
C = min(Ct, Cm, Cn)
```
where:
- Ct: Transaction processing capacity
- Cm: Memory capacity
- Cn: Network capacity

#### 6.2 Throughput analysis
Maximum throughput T:

```math
T = min(1/tp, 1/tv, 1/ts)
```
where:
- tp: Processing time
- tv: Validation time
- ts: Storage time

| Balance Check| O(n)           | O(1)            | 2.96x         |

#### 7.2 Memory usage
```math
M(n) = 128 + 64n bytes (Cython)
M(n) = 256 + 96n bytes (Python)
```
where n is the number of transactions.

### 8. Examples usage with mathematical context

Step-by-step usage example:

```python
from bitcoin_lite import Transaction

# we initialize with theoretical capacity C
C = min(1000, # tx/s
        available_memory/transaction_size,
        network_bandwidth/transaction_size)

# then create transaction with amount a
a = 100.0  # units
tx = Transaction("Alice", "Bob", a)

# now we validate against balance B
B = tx.get_sender_balance()
assert B >= a, "Insufficient balance"

# in the end, we execute with timestamp t
t = current_time()
tx_id = tx.execute()
```

Streamed transaction:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from database import TransactionDatabase
    
    # initialize analytics
    db = TransactionDatabase()
    analytics = TransactionAnalytics(db)
    
    # Calc. metrics
    metrics = analytics.calculate_network_metrics()
    print(f"""
    Network metrics:
    ---------------
    Mean transaction amount: {metrics.mean_amount:.2f}
    Standard deviation: {metrics.std_dev:.2f}
    Transaction density: {metrics.transaction_density:.4f}
    Network load: {metrics.network_load:.2f}
    System capacity: {metrics.system_capacity:.2f} tx/s
    """)

```

Dashboard example for analystical aspects of the transaction system:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from database import TransactionDatabase
    
    # init. database and data generator
    db = TransactionDatabase()
