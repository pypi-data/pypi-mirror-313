# KeePassDiff

I started using KeePass back in 2021 and I have been using it since then to store my passwords. But I didn't set up a proper way to sync the database between my devices. So I ended up with multiple databases with different passwords and entries. I wanted to **compare the databases and merge them** into one. Well, KeePass doesn't provide a way to compare two databases. Hence this project.

## Usage

- Open two KeePass databases in diff.
- See the differences and conflicting entries between the two databases.
- Then using merge left, merge right options decide which entries or groups to keep and which to discard.
- Finally, export the merged database.

## Features

- [x] Support for KeePassXC databases
- [x] Uploading and unlocking two KeePass databases
- [x] Supports both password and keyfile authentication
- [x] Visual diff of entries and groups
- [x] Support for entry groups
- [ ] Hierarchical view of database contents
- [ ] Merging individual entries and groups between databases
- [ ] Exporting the final merged database
- [ ] Resolving conflicting entries with preferred ones
- [ ] Command-line interface for batch processing
- [ ] Copying passwords to clipboard, clearing clipboard after timeout

## Security

All database handling is done locally and no data is stored or transmitted. Temporary files are securely deleted after use, passwords are not stored.
