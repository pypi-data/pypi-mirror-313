# Zenif

Zenif (pronounced "Zenith") is a powerful and versatile Python module designed to enhance the efficiency and performance of your programs. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Zenif offers a suite of tools to streamline your workflow and improve code management. Zenif currently enables developers with a simple yet highly customizable logger with support for multiple streams, a set of utility decorators, like `@cache` and `@rate_limiter`, a handful of tools to create a command-line interface with interactive prompts and argument handling, and easy-to-use schemas to validate your user's inputs.
