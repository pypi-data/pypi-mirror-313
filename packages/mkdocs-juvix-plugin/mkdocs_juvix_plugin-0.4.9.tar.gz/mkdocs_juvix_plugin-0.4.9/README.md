This is a plugin for MkDocs to build static websites and highlight Juvix
codeblocks using [the Juvix Compiler](https://docs.juvix.org), and many more. It
also adds a CLI tool to help you get started with a new project called
`juvix-mkdocs`.

Checkout the [documentation website](https://anoma.github.io/juvix-mkdocs/) to
