## Outlier Detection for Time-series Data
This package identifies outlier(s) for a given time-series dataset in simple steps. It supports day, week, month and 
quarter level time-series data.

### Installation

```bash
pip install pycatcher
```

### DataFrame Arguments
* First column in the dataframe must be a date column ('YYYY-MM-DD') and the last column a numeric column 
(sum or total count for the time period) to detect outliers using Seasonal Decomposition algorithms.
* Last column must be a numeric column to detect outliers using Moving Average and Z-score algorithm. 

### Package Functions
* `detect_outliers(df):` Detect outliers in a time-series dataframe using seasonal trend decomposition when there 
is at least 2 years of data, otherwise we can use Inter Quartile Range (IQR) for smaller timeframe.
* `detect_outliers_today(df):` Detect outliers for the current date in a time-series dataframe.
* `detect_outliers_latest(df):` Detect latest outliers in a time-series dataframe.
* `detect_outliers_iqr(df):` Detect outliers in a time-series dataframe when there's less than 2 years of data.
* `detect_outliers_moving_average(df):` Detect outliers using moving average method. 
* `detect_outliers_stl(df):` Detect outliers using Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LOESS (STL).

### Diagnostic Plots
* `build_seasonal_plot(df):` Build seasonal plot (additive or multiplicative) for a given dataframe.
* `build_iqr_plot(df):` Build IQR plot for a given dataframe (for less than 2 years of data).
* `build_monthwise_plot(df):` Build month-wise plot for a given dataframe.
* `build_decomposition_results(df):` Get seasonal decomposition results for a given dataframe.
* `build_classical_seasonal_outliers_plot(df):` Show outliers using Classical Seasonal Decomposition algorithm.
* `build_moving_average_outliers_plot(df):` Show outliers using Moving Average and Z-score algorithm.
* `build_stl_outliers_plot(df):` Show outliers using Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LOESS (STL).
* `conduct_stationarity_check(df):` Conduct stationarity checks for a feature (dataframe's count column).

### Highlights
 Unlike many open-source packages for outlier detection, PyCatcher provides several distinctive features:
* **Automatic Model Selection:** 
PyCatcher automatically detects whether to use an additive or multiplicative
decomposition model, ensuring the most accurate detection of outliers based on the characteristics of your data.
* **Dynamic Method Selection Based on Data Size:**
PyCatcher seamlessly switches between Seasonal Trend Decomposition (for datasets spanning at least two years) and
Inter Quartile Range (IQR) for shorter time periods, offering flexibility without manual intervention.
* **Wide Time Frequency Support:**
Supports multiple time-series frequencies — including daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly data—without requiring 
users to pre-process or adjust their datasets.
* **Choice for Different Seasonal Trend Algorithms:** Support for outlier detection using both Classical Seasonal Trend 
Decomposition 
and Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LOESS (STL) algorithms.
* **Integrated Diagnostics:** PyCatcher includes comprehensive diagnostic tools, enabling users to visualize outliers, 
trends 
and seasonal patterns, evaluate data stationarity, and analyze decomposition results.
* **User Interface:** Availability of a simple user interface for the users to upload file for outlier detection using IQR.
Future versions will include advanced algorithms.

### Example Usage
