# nmrlineshapeanalyser: ss-NMR peak shape deconvolution and line shape analysis

nmrlineshapeanalyser is an open-source Python package designed to make peak deconvolution or line shape analysis easier.

This package is for now only compatible with Bruker's NMR data.

# Key Features

 - Load and process Bruker NMR data
 - Select and analyse specific spectral regions
 - Perform peak fitting using Pseudo-Voigt profiles
 - Calculate detailed peak metrics and statistics
 - Generate publication-quality visuals
 - Export results in various formats:
       - txt: calculated peak metrics and statistics
       - png: visualisation of the fitted spectral regions
       - csv: save plots to a file
