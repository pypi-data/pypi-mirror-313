# pyFitsServer
[**pyFitsServer**](https://github.com/GillySpace27/pyfitsserver) is a lightweight server to facilitate the rendering and previewing of FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files. It is designed to work in conjunction with the [**pyFitsVSC**](https://github.com/GillySpace27/pyfitsvsc) Visual Studio Code extension, providing backend services to support the frontend visualization capabilities.

## Description
The **pyFitsServer** acts as a backend server for serving FITS file previews. It processes the FITS files and provides the necessary data and/or images to the **pyFitsVSC** extension. This server is general enough to serve FITS previews to other clients, too.

<!-- ## Prerequisites -->


## Installation
### Install from Pypi
To install **pyFitsServer** from pypi:
1. **Make a virtual environment**
    This will help to manage project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
2. **Use pip to install the package**
    ```bash
    pip install pyfitsserver
    ```
3. **Run the server**
    ```bash
    python -m pyfitsserver
    ```

### Build from Source
To install and run **pyFitsServer** from github, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GillySpace27/pyFitsServer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd pyFitsServer
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

    This will help to manage project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
    or invoke the startup script
    ```bash
    python -m pyfitsserver
    ```

6. **Confirm the server is running properly by running tests (from the project root)**:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

If everything is set up correctly, the server should be running and you should see output indicating that it is ready to accept requests.

## Usage
Once the **pyFitsServer** is running, it will be ready to interface with the **pyFitsVSC** extension for Visual Studio Code. The server will handle backend operations, such as rendering and processing the FITS files, and send the necessary data back to the **pyFitsVSC** extension for display. See the integration instructions below.

## Integration with pyFitsVSC

**pyFitsVSC** is a VS Code extension designed to provide previews of FITS files seamlessly within the editor. Here’s how to use it in conjunction with **pyFitsServer**:

1. **Ensure the server is running** by following the [installation steps](#installation).

2. **Install the pyFitsVSC extension** by following these steps:

    - **To install from the precompiled `.vsix` file:**
        - Check the binary files included in this build for a functional precompiled version of the `.vsix` file and download it.
        - Open VS Code.
        - Go to Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
        - Click the three-dot menu (`...`).
        - Select `Install from VSIX...`.
        - Browse to and select the precompiled `.vsix` file.
    - **To compile and package from source (if needed):**
        1. **Clone the repository**:
            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/GillySpace27/pyfitsvsc.git
            ```
        2. **Navigate to the directory**:
            ```bash
            cd pyfitsvsc
            ```
        3. **Install VSCE if not already installed**:
            ```bash
            npm install -g vsce
            ```
        4. **Compile the TypeScript code**:
            ```bash
            npm run compile
            ```
        5. **Package the extension**:
            ```bash
            vsce package
            ```
        6. **Install the VSIX file**:
            - Open VS Code.
            - Go to Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
            - Click the three-dot menu (`...`).
            - Select `Install from VSIX...`.
            - Browse to and select the `.vsix` file created in the previous step.
