    r"""
    Calculates the circumferential completeness indices of the specified circles. The circumferential completeness index
    is a metric that measures how well a circle fitted to a set of points is covered by points. It was proposed in
    `Krisanski, Sean, Mohammad Sadegh Taskhiri, and Paul Turner. "Enhancing Methods for Under-canopy Unmanned Aircraft \
    System Based Photogrammetry in Complex Forests for Tree Diameter Measurement." Remote Sensing 12.10 (2020): 1652. \
    <https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12101652>`__ To calculate the circumference completeness index of a circle, the circle is
    divided into :code:`num_regions` angular regions. An angular region is considered complete if it contains at least
    one point whose distance to the circle outline is equal to or less than :code:`max_dist`. The circumferential
    completeness index is then defined as the proportion of angular regions that are complete.

    Args:
        circles: Parameters of the circles for which to compute the circumferential completeness indices. Each circle
            must be defined by three parameters in the following order: x-coordinate of the center, y-coordinate of the
            center, radius.
        xy: Coordinates of the set of 2D points to which the circles were fitted.
        num_regions: Number of angular regions.
        max_dist: Maximum distance a point can have to the circle outline to be counted as part of the circle. If set to
            :code:`None`, points are counted as part of the circle if their distance to the circle is center is in the
            interval :math:`[0.7 \cdot r, 1.3 \cdot r]` where :math:`r` is the circle radius. Defaults to :code:`None`.

    Returns:
        Circumferential completeness indices of the circles.
