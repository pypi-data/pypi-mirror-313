## An extensible mail notification daemon

Mailnagger is a daemon program that checks POP3 and IMAP servers for new mail.
On mail arrival it performs various actions provided by plugins.
Mailnagger comes with a set of desktop-independent default plugins for
visual/sound notifications, script execution etc. and can be extended
with additional plugins easily.

Mailnagger is a fork of [Mailnag](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag).

__This project needs your support!__

If you like Mailnagger, please help to keep it going by [contributing code](https://github.com/tikank/mailnagger),
[reporting/fixing bugs](https://github.com/tikank/mailnagger/issues),
[translating strings into your native language](https://github.com/tikank/mailnagger/tree/master/po),
or [writing docs](https://github.com/tikank/mailnagger/tree/master/docs).


## Installation

Easiest way to install Mailnagger from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mailnagger/) is to use
[pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx/).

Run
```
    pipx install mailnagger
```
though make sure the requirements stated below are met.


### Requirements

* python (>= 3.9)
* pygobject
* gir-notify (>= 0.7.6)
* gir-gtk-3.0
* gir-gdkpixbuf-2.0
* gir-glib-2.0
* gir-gst-plugins-base-1.0
* python-dbus
* pyxdg
* gettext
* gir1.2-secret-1 (optional)


## Configuration

Run `mailnagger-config` to setup Mailnagger.

Closing the configuration window will start Mailnagger automatically.

> **Note:**
> Mailnagger uses same configuration files and secret storage as Mailnag.
> They are currently compatible, but there will be someday some kind of
> migration to Mailnagger's own configuration files.


### Default Mail Client

Clicking a mail notification popup will open the default mail client specified in `GNOME Control Center -> Details -> Default Applications`.
If you're a webmail (e.g. gmail) user and want your account to be launched in a browser, please install a tool like [gnome-gmail](http://gnome-gmail.sourceforge.net).


### Desktop Integration

By default, Mailnagger emits libnotify notifications, which work fine on
most desktop environments but are visible for a few seconds only.
If you like to have a tighter desktop integration (e.g. a permanently visible indicator in your top panel) you have to install an appropriate
extension/plugin for your desktop shell.

Mailnag has following desktop extensions:

* GNOME-Shell ([GNOME-Shell extension](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-gnome-shell)) 
* KDE ([Plasma 5 applet by driglu4it](https://store.kde.org/p/1420222/))
* Cinnamon ([Applet by hyOzd](https://bitbucket.org/hyOzd/mailnagapplet))
* Elementary Pantheon ([MessagingMenu plugin](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-messagingmenu-plugin))
* XFCE ([MessagingMenu plugin](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-messagingmenu-plugin))

Since Mailnagger is essentially same as Mailnag, those extensions should/might
work with Mailnagger.

Furthermore, GNOME users can also install the [GOA plugin](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-goa-plugin),
which makes Mailnagger aware of email accounts specified in GNOME Online Accounts.


### Troubleshooting

__Gmail doesn't work__

If Mailnagger is unable to connect to your Gmail account, please try the following solutions:
* Install the [GOA plugin](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag-goa-plugin) to connect via GNOME online accounts
* Have a look at the [FAQ](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag/wiki/FAQ)
* Try to apply [this](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag/issues/190) workaround

__Other issues__

If Mailnagger doesn't work properly for you, either examine the system log
for errors (`journalctl -b _COMM=mailnagger`)
or run `mailnagger` in a terminal and observe the output.
