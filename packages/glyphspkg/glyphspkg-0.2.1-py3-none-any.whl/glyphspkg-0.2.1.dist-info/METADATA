# glyphspkg

Converter for GlyphsApp package to monolithic files and vice versa.

[Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com) supports two different file formats, both of
which are based on plist. One, using the suffix `.glyphs`, is a monolithic
file, the other, using the suffix `.glyphspackage`, is a special folder that
appears as one file on macOS.

The _package_ variant has advantages when used in SCM systems, but some
external tools only support the monolithic file format. Thatâ€™s where this
converter tool comes in. It can be integrated into font build workflows to
convert package files before further processing.


## Installation

`glyphspkg` is listed on PyPi, so you can install it via pip.


## Usage

```
usage: glyphspkg [-h] [-o OUTPUT_PATH] glyphsfile [glyphsfile ...]

positional arguments:
  glyphsfile            Path to the glyphs file or package to be converted.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_PATH, --output OUTPUT_PATH
                        Output path for converted files. If omitted, the file is saved next to the original.
```
