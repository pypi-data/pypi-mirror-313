## Why ORruns?

During my Operations Research studies, I frequently encountered these challenges:

- 📊 Experimental data scattered across different locations
- 🔄 Tedious experiment repetition and messy parameter management
- 📈 Repetitive visualization code writing
- 🤝 Lack of unified experiment management platform

**ORruns** was born to solve these problems! I aim to provide OR researchers with a modern, intuitive, and powerful experiment management tool.

## ✨ Features

### Elegant Experiment Management

```python
@experiment_manager(times=10, parallel=True)
def optimize_problem(tracker):
    # Configure experiment parameters
    tracker.log_params({
        "population_size": 100,
        "generations": 1000
    })
    
    # Run optimization
    result = optimize()
    
    # Track results automatically
    tracker.log_metrics({
        "pareto_front_size": len(result.pareto_front),
        "hypervolume": result.hypervolume
    })
    tracker.log_artifact("pareto_front.png", plt.gcf())
    
    return result
```

### Intuitive Web Interface

## 🚀 Vision

```bash
pip install orruns
```

- 🌟 Build an open, active Operations Research community
- 🔧 Create better experiment management tools
- 📚 Share knowledge and best practices
- 🤝 Facilitate academic exchange

## 💡 Get Involved

> "Good tools make research twice as efficient. Join me in making OR experiment management better!"

### 🌱 Growing Together

As a personal project:
- Every suggestion is carefully considered
- You can influence core feature design
- You'll witness and shape the project's growth

## 🎯 Roadmap

Exciting features planned for the future:

- 📊 **Enhanced Analytics** (v0.2.0)
  - Dynamic Pareto Front Visualization
  - Advanced Statistical Analysis Tools
  - Experiment Comparison System

- 🛠️ **Improved User Experience** (v0.3.0)
  - Experiment Backup and Recovery
  - Publication-Ready Results Export
  - Powerful Command Line Tools
