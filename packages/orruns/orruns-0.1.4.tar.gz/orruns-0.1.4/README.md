## Why ORruns?

During my Operations Research studies, I frequently encountered these challenges:

- 📊 Experimental data scattered across different locations
- 🔄 Tedious experiment repetition and messy parameter management
- 📈 Repetitive visualization code writing
- 🤝 Lack of unified experiment management platform

**ORruns** was born to solve these problems! I aim to provide OR researchers with a modern, intuitive, and powerful experiment management tool.

## ✨ Features

### Elegant Experiment Management

```python
@experiment_manager(times=10, parallel=True)
def optimize_problem(tracker):
    # Configure experiment parameters
    tracker.log_params({
        "population_size": 100,
        "generations": 1000
    })
    
    # Run optimization
    result = optimize()
    
    # Track results automatically
    tracker.log_metrics({
        "pareto_front_size": len(result.pareto_front),
        "hypervolume": result.hypervolume
    })
    tracker.log_artifact("pareto_front.png", plt.gcf())
    
    return result
```

### Intuitive Web Interface
