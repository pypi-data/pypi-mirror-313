OpenPO simplifies building synthetic datasets for preference tuning from 200+ LLMs.

## What is OpenPO?
OpenPO is an open source library that simplifies the process of building synthetic datasets for LLM preference tuning. By collecting outputs from 200 + LLMs and ranking them using various techniques, OpenPO helps developers build better, more fine-tuned language models with minimal effort.

## Key Features

- 🔌 **Multiple LLM Support**: Call 200+ models from HuggingFace and OpenRouter

- 🧪 **Research-Backed Methodologies**: Implementation of various methodologies on data synthesis from latest research papers. (feature coming soon!)

- 🤝 **OpenAI API Compatibility**: Fully support OpenAI API format

- 💾 **Flexible Storage:** Out of the box storage providers for Hugging Face and S3.


## Installation
### Install from PyPI (recommended)
OpenPO uses pip for installation. Run the following command in the terminal to install OpenPO:

```bash
pip install openpo
```

### Install from source
Clone the repository first then run the follow command
```bash
cd openpo
poetry install
```

## Getting Started
OpenPO defaults to Hugging Face when provider argument is not set.

```python
import os
from openpo.client import OpenPO

client = OpenPO(api_key="your-huggingface-api-key") # no need to pass in the key if environment variable is already set.

response = client.completions(
    models = [
        "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct",
        "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3",
        "microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct",
    ],
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": PROMPT},
        {"role": "system", "content": MESSAGE},
    ],
)
```

To use with OpenRouter, set the provider to `openrouter`

```python
# make request to OpenRouter
client = OpenPO(api_key="<your-openrouter-api-key", provider='openrouter')

response = client.completions(
    models = [
        "qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct",
        "mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3",
        "microsoft/phi-3.5-mini-128k-instruct",
    ],
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": PROMPT},
        {"role": "system", "content": MESSAGE},
    ],

)
```

OpenPO takes default model parameters as a dictionary. Take a look at the documentation for more detail.

```python
response = client.completions(
    models = [
        "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct",
        "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3",
        "microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct",
    ],
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": PROMPT},
        {"role": "system", "content": MESSAGE},
    ],
    params={
        "max_tokens": 500,
        "temperature": 1.0,
    }
)

```

### Storing Data
Use out of the box storage class to easily upload and download data.

```python
from openpo.storage.huggingface import HuggingFaceStorage
hf_storage = HuggingFaceStorage(repo_id="my-dataset-repo", api_key="hf-token") # api_key can also be set as environment variable.

# push data to repo
preference = {"prompt": "text", "preferred": "response1", "rejected": "response2"}
hf_storage.push_to_repo(data=preference)

# Load data from repo
data = hf_storage.load_from_repo()
```

## Structured Outputs (JSON Mode)
OpenPO supports structured outputs using Pydantic model.

> [!NOTE]
> OpenRouter does not natively support structured outputs. This leads to inconsistent behavior from some models when structured output is used with OpenRouter.
>
> It is recommended to use HuggingFace models for structured output.


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openpo.client import OpenPO

client = OpenPO(api_key="your-huggingface-api-key")

class ResponseModel(BaseModel):
    response: str


res = client.completions(
    models=["Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct"],
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": PROMPT},
        {"role": "system", "content": MESSAGE},
    ],
    params = {
        "response_format": ResponseFormat,
    }
)
```
