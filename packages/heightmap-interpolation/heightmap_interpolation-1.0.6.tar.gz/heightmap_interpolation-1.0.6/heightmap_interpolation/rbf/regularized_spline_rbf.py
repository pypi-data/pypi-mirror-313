def regularized_spline_rbf(r, e):
    """Regularized spline

    Definition of the spline with tension from [2]. You can also find a brief description of its behaviour in [1].
    Note that [1] suggests using a polynomial of degree 1 with this RBF.

    Args:
        r: value to evaluate.
        e: tension parameter.

    Returns:
        value of the RBF at r.
