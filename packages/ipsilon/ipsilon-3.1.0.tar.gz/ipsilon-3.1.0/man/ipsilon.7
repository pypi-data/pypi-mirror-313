.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Ipsilon is an Identity Provider (IdP) that implements standard Authentication
and Federation protocols like SAML, and integrates with Enterprise
Authentication systems to provide easy to use Single Sign On capabilities to
Web Applications and Services.

An IdP server allows users to authenticate against any identity backend, whether that is a corporate LDAP server or even just local files, and allows applications to authenticate users without having to worry about the sort of authentication infrastructure is being used.

Ipsilon supports applications to authenticate users via either the SAML2, OpenID or OpenID Connect/OAuth2 protocols, and more protocols can be added with plugins.
