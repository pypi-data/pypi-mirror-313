## This is an unofficial implementation of GAFF atom types based on Table 1 in the following article:
## * Wang, J.; Wolf, R. M.; Caldwell, J. W.; Kollman, P. A.; Case, D. A. Development and Testing of a General Amber Force Field. Journal of Computational Chemistry 2004, 25 (9), 1157â€“1174. https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.20035.
## It covers the 35 basic atom types and 23 special atom types.
## Because of the special treatment for conjugated atoms, it requires GaffTyper typing engine.

## RDKit is used here for determining aromaticity, which is not consistent with GAFF.
## Especially, GAFF does not consider 5-member rings as aromatic.
## For some molecules, this definition does not give the same results as the official implementation in AmberTools.
## Therefore, this definition is mainly used for optimizing a force field by taking GAFF as an initial guess.

## Hybridization assignment is nasty. E.g. N in N-c1ccccc1 is SP2 hybridized, whereas P in P-c1ccccc1 is SP3 hybridized.
## N in N-C=C is considered as SP2 hybridized by RDKit, but it is not a strong planer structure.
## Therefore, hybridization is avoided if the type can be correctly assigned with other information.

n      [N;X3][C,S,P]=[O,S]      ## amide. Cannot use hybridization. RDKit treat N in NC=O as SP2, but in NS=O as SP3
n1     [N^1;X1]                 ## SP1 nitrogen. E.g. nitrile
n2     [N^2;X2]                 ## SP2 nitrogen with 2 coordinates and a double bond. E.g. imine
n3     [N^3;X3]                 ## SP3 nitrogen with 3 coordinates. E.g. amine
n4     [N^3;X4]                 ## SP3 nitrogen with 4 coordinates. E.g. ammonium
na     [N;X3](*=*)(*=*)         ## SP2 nitrogen with 3 coordinates. E.g. amine connected two alkene groups. Cannot use N^2, because RDKit considers N in NC=C as SP2
