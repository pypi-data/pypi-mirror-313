You can use 🐍 python to perform analysis with Aplos NCA using API calls via secure HTTPS requests.

> We'll keep this maintained as we use it for our customer demos.  So keep coming back for new features.


## API Settings

> 🛑 A valid Aplos NCA Account is required. 🛑
> In order to run the executions and connect to our system, you will need a valid account with an active subscription.

> You'll need your username (email address and a password) a Cognito Client Id
> which allows the USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow, and your API URL.  
> 
> The Client Id (aka Cognito Client Key) and API URL can be found in your user account.
> Your username is your email address and your password would have been provided to you during your
> onboarding or with a "forgot password" request and reset.
