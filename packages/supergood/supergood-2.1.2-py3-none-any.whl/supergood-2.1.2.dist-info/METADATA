# Python

The Supergood Python client connects Supergood to your Python application. Follow these steps to integrate with the Python client.

## 1. Install the Supergood library

```bash
pip install supergood
```

## 2. Initialize the Supergood Library

**Environment variables**

Set the environment variables `SUPERGOOD_CLIENT_ID` and `SUPERGOOD_CLIENT_SECRET` using the API keys generated in the [getting started instructions](../getting-started.md).

Initialize the Supergood client at the root of your application, or anywhere you're making API calls.

```python
from supergood import Client

Client.initialize()
```

**Passing keys**

You can also pass the API keys in manually without setting environment variables.

Replace `<CLIENT_ID>` and `<CLIENT_SECRET>` with the API keys you generated in the [getting started instructions](../getting-started.md).

```python
from supergood import Client

Client.initialize(client_id="<CLIENT_ID>", client_secret_id="<CLIENT_SECRET>")
```

Note: If your application makes use of the `multiprocessing` library to make API calls, you'll need to initialize a client for each `Process`.&#x20;

## 3. Monitor your API calls

You're all set to use Supergood!

Head back to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.supergood.ai) to start monitoring your API calls and receiving reports.
