## Usage

### Authenticate First

First-time vibe check: the package will ask you to log in. After that, you’re golden with `token.json`—just smooth sailing for all your future runs.

### Import the Tools

```python
from GblogWhisperer import post_instantly, schedule_post, delete_post  
```

### Instant Post

```python
post_instantly(  
    blog_id="YOUR_BLOG_ID",  
    client_secret_file="path/to/client_secret.json",  
    title="Your Blog Title",  
    content="Your Blog Content"  
)  
```

### Schedule the Drop

```python
schedule_post(  
    blog_id="YOUR_BLOG_ID",  
    client_secret_file="path/to/client_secret.json",  
    title="Your Scheduled Blog Title",  
    content="Your Blog Content",  
    publish_time="DD/MM/YYYY-HH:MM:SS",  # Example: 25/12/2024-15:30:00  
    utc_offset="+05:30"  # Make timezone moves effortlessly  
)  
```

### Delete the Cheugy Posts

```python
delete_post(  
    blog_id="YOUR_BLOG_ID",  
    client_secret_file="path/to/client_secret.json",  
    title="Title of the Blog Post to Delete"  
)  
```

If there are duplicate titles, you’ll get a vibe-check prompt to choose which one gets axed.

## Pro Tip: Use `time.sleep`

Don’t be that person spamming the Blogger API. Stay mindful with a short breather between calls using `time.sleep()`. It’s low-key essential for avoiding rate-limit drama.

```python
import time  

# Instant drop  
post_instantly(blog_id, client_secret_file, "Title 1", "Content 1")  
time.sleep(2)  # Low-key chill for 2 seconds  

# Scheduled vibe  
schedule_post(blog_id, client_secret_file, "Title 2", "Content 2", "10/12/2024-15:30:00", "+05:30")  
time.sleep(2)  

# Delete that cheugy post  
delete_post(blog_id, client_secret_file, "Title 1")  
```

## Dependencies

- **`google-auth-oauthlib`**: For keeping your login game strong.
- **`google-api-python-client`**: Talks to Blogger so you don’t have to.

---

## Setting Up Your Rizz with OAuth

1. Slide into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Make a new project or pick one you’re already vibing with.
3. Turn on the **Blogger API** for your project.
4. Set up OAuth creds for a **Desktop App**—no cap.
5. Download the JSON file, name it `client_secret.json`, and stash it somewhere safe.

---

## Notes

- **Timezone Rizz**: `schedule_post` flexes UTC offsets like `+05:30` or `-08:00` to keep your drops sharp.
- **No Login Loops**: With `token.json`, you’re set after the first vibe check.
- **Rate Limit Respect**: Sprinkle `time.sleep()` to keep things mindful.
