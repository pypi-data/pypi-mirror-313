              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

Welcome to EnvCloak, the ultimate sidekick for developers, ops folks, and anyone who’s ever accidentally committed an API key to version control. (Yes, I know… it happens to the best of us. 😅) EnvCloak takes the stress out of managing environment variables by wrapping them in the cozy blanket of encryption, so you can focus on building awesome things—without the lingering fear of a security breach.

> If you find EnvCloak useful, please ⭐ the repository. It helps others discover this project! - thank you!

## 🛠️ Installation

In order to install `envcloak` simply run:
```bash
pip install envcloak
```
or if you want `dev` tools too 😎:
```bash
pip install envcloak[dev]
```

> 👋 There are also [self-contained binaries](examples/cli/README.md#get-yourself-a-envcloak-without-requirement-to-use-python-) for `Windows`, `Linux` and `MacOS`, don't have to use python at all! 🥳

## 🚀 Example Workflow

> ℹ️ More examples are present in [examples](./examples) section.

### Generating key:

```bash
# With password and salt
envcloak generate-key-from-password --password "YourTopSecretPassword" \
--salt "e3a1c8b0d4f6e2c7a5b9d6f0cr2ad1a2" --output secretkey.key

# With password without salt (we will add random salt then)
envcloak generate-key-from-password --password "YourTopSecretPassword" --output secretkey.key

# From random password and salt
envcloak generate-key --output secretkey.key
```

![generate-key-gif](https://veinar.pl/envcloak-generate-key.gif)

> **What it does:** generates your private key used to encrypt and decrypt files. **Appends (or creates if needed) .gitignore as well** as super-hero should! 🎉

> ⚠ **If someone knows your password and salt (option 1) can recreate same `key` - keep those variables safe as `key` itself** ⚠

### Encrypting Variables:

```bash
envcloak encrypt --input .env --output .env.enc --key-file mykey.key
```

![encrypt-gif](https://veinar.pl/envcloak-encrypt.gif)

> **What it does:** Encrypts your `.env` file with a specified key, outputting a sparkling `.env.enc` file.

### Decrypting Variables:

```bash
envcloak decrypt --input .env.enc --output .env --key-file mykey.key
```

![decrypt-gif](https://veinar.pl/envcloak-decrypt.gif)

> **What it does:** Decrypts the `.env.enc` file back to `.env` using the same key. Voilà!

or you may want to use it ...

### 🐍 In Your Python Code

```python
from envcloak import load_encrypted_env

load_encrypted_env('.env.enc', key_file='mykey.key').to_os_env()
# Now os.environ contains the decrypted variables

```
> **What it does:** Loads decrypted variables directly into `os.environ`. Secrets delivered, stress-free.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details
🔑 Encryption Algorithm

* Powered by AES-256-GCM for speed and security.
* Provides [`sha3` validation](docs/sha_validation.md) of files and content.

🗝️ Key Storage

* Local key files with strict permissions.
* Secure environment variables for CI/CD systems.

🗂️ File Handling

* Works with individual files.
* Works with directories using `--directory` instead of `--input` on `encrypt` and `decrypt`.
> ℹ️ EnvCloak process files in batch one-by-one. 
* Can [recursively](docs/recursive.md) encrypt or decrypt directories.
* Can list files in directory that will be encrypted using `--preview` flag (ℹ️ only for directories and it does not commit the operation!).

🚦 Error Handling

* Clear, friendly error messages for any hiccups.
* Gracefully handles missing keys or corrupted files.

✅ Compatibility of pipelines and systems

* k8s / OKD / OCP deployments
* Jenkins pipelines
* Azure Pipelines
* Github Workflows
* Gitlab CI/CD Pipelines


## 🎉 Why EnvCloak?

Because you deserve peace of mind. EnvCloak wraps your environment variables in layers of encryption goodness, protecting them from prying eyes and accidental slips. Whether you’re a solo dev or part of a big team, this tool is here to make managing secrets simple, secure, and downright pleasant.

So go ahead—secure your `.env` like a boss. And remember, EnvCloak isn’t just a tool; it’s your secret-keeping partner in crime. (But the good kind of crime. 😎)

### Comparison of EnvCloak with Alternatives

| Tool          | Strengths                               | Weaknesses                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **EnvCloak**  | Lightweight, Python-native, simple to integrate with CI/CD workflows. | Limited ecosystem compared to established tools. |
| [**Sops**](https://github.com/mozilla/sops)      | Integrates with cloud providers, supports partial file encryption. | More complex to configure for beginners. |
| [**BlackBox**](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox)  | Simple file-based encryption for Git repos. | Limited to GPG, lacks flexibility.     |
| [**Vault**](https://www.vaultproject.io/)     | Robust, enterprise-grade with dynamic secrets. | High complexity, overkill for small projects. |
| [**Confidant**](https://lyft.github.io/confidant/) | AWS IAM integration, designed for secure CI/CD workflows. | Requires AWS, limited to its ecosystem. |
| [**Doppler**](https://www.doppler.com/)   | Centralized secret management with CI/CD integration. | Paid plans for advanced features, cloud-reliant. |

> **Key Differentiator for EnvCloak**: Focused specifically on Python developers and lightweight CI/CD needs, making it ideal for small to medium projects.
