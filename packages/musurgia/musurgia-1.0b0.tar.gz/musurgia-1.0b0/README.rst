This library will contain all my important composition tools. At this moment, there are some tools for random data generation and permutation, a PDF generator, and a fractal tree structure which is the base of one of my most important tools: fractal music. Work in progress! No documentation for now, so you have to read the code :-]]

Prerequisites
=============

To run the tests locally, the following external tools are required:

1. **pdftocairo** (from Poppler-utils)

   Installation:
   - **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):** ``sudo apt install poppler-utils``
   - **macOS:** ``brew install poppler``
   - **Windows:** `Download Poppler for Windows <https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows>`_ and add it to your PATH.
