CurveSimulator: A Star System and Lightcurve Simulator

CurveSimulator generates a video of the movements and eclipses of celestial bodies and the 
resulting lightcurve.
The video simultanously displays a view of the star system from the top and from the side alongside
the lightcurve of the system's total luminosity over time.

It takes just 2 lines of python code to produce the video.

CurveSimulator is fast and the videos use little disk space. A video takes about the same time 
to produce as its playing time and uses less than 0.5 MB disc space per minute.

In a configuration file, specify the physical properties of the stars and planets in your system. 
Also, provide some parameters of the video you want to make.

Get started quickly by having a look at CurveSimulator's
