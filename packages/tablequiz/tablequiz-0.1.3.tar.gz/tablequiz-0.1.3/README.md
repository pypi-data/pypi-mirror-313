# Table Quiz Master

Run table quizes using Python and Reveal.js.

Put your questions and answers into a `quiz.yaml` and use `tablequiz serve quiz.yaml` to run a server with all the questions, answers and other slides you specify ready to go.

# Basic Use

If you want to run directly without installing you can use `pipx` or `uvx`:

- For pipx: `pipx run tablequiz serve quiz.yaml`
- For uvx: `uvx tablequiz serve quiz.yaml`

Otherwise you can install `tablequiz` as a dependency.
