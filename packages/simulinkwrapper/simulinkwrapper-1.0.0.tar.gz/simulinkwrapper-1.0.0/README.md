# SimulinkWrapper
SimulinkWrapper is a simple Python wrapper around Simulink that allows one to simulate an existing model in Simulink from Python. This is particularly useful for control systems design and implementation, as the control algorithms can then be implemented in Python, while the plant model is run by Simulink. This way, custom control systems making use of powerful Python libraries (e.g. machine learning libraries) can be tested on Simulink models. This frees the designer from having to devise a way to model complicated systems in Python (e.g. using nonlinear state-space models).
