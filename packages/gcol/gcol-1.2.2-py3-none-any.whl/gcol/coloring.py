    Given a node coloring ``c`` of a graph ``G``, this method returns the set

    A Kempe chain is a connected set of nodes in a graph that alternates
    between two colors [1]_. Equivalently, it is a maximal connected subgraph
    that contains nodes of at most two colors. Interchanging the colors of
    the nodes in a Kempe chain creates a new coloring that uses the same
    number of colors or one fewer color. Two $k$-colorings of a graph are
    considered *Kempe equivalent* if one can be obtained from the other
    through a series of Kempe chain interchanges [2]_. It is also known that,
    if $k$ is larger than the degeneracy of a graph, then all $k$-colorings
    of this graph are Kempe equivalent [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph that we want to compute a Kempe chain for.

    c : dict
        A node coloring of ``G``. Pairs of adjacent nodes cannot be allocated
        to the same color. Any uncolored nodes ``u`` should have ``c[u]==-1``.

    s : node
        The source node that we will generate the Kempe chain from.

    j : int
        The second color to use. The first color is that of ``s``.

    Returns
    -------
    set
        The set of nodes, reachable from ``s``, that alternate between colors
        ``i`` and ``j`` (where ``c[s]==i``).

    Example Kempe chain = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 17, 18, 19}

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``G`` is a directed graph or a multigraph.

    ValueError
        If ``c`` contains a pair of adjacent nodes assigned to the same color.

        If ``c`` contains an invalid color label or no color label for ``s``.

        If ``G`` contains a node that is not in ``c``.

    Notes
    -----
    This method uses an extension of breadth-first search and operates in
    $O(n+m)$ time. If ``c[s]==j``, then the Kempe chain contains node ``s``
    only.

def max_independent_set(G, weight=None, it_limit=0):
    """Attempt to identify the largest independent set of nodes in a graph.

    Here, nodes can also be allocated weights if desired.

    The maximum independent set in a graph $G$ is the largest subset of nodes
    in which none are adjacent. The size of the largest independent in a graph
    $G$ is known as the independence number of $G$ and is often denoted by
    $\\alpha(G)$. Similarly, the maximum-weighted independent set in $G$ is
    the subset of mutually nonadjacent nodes whose weight-total is maximized.

    The problem of determining a maximum(-weighted) independent set of nodes
    is NP-hard. Consequently, this method makes use of a polynomial-time
    heuristic based on local search. It will always return an independent
    set but offers no guarantees on whether this is the optimal solution. The
    algorithm halts once the iteration limit has been reached.

    Note that the similar problem of determining the maximum(-weighted)
    independent set of edges is equivalent to finding a maximum(-weighted)
    matching in a graph. This is a polynomially solvable problem and can be
    solved by the Blossom algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        An independent set of nodes in this graph will be returned.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
        If ``None``, every node is assumed to have a weight of ``1``. If a
        string, this should correspond to a defined node attribute. All node
        weights must be positive.

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Each iteration has
        a complexity $O(m + n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is
        the number of edges.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        A list containing the nodes belonging to the independent set.

    --------

    Independent set = [0, 1, 3]

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``G`` is a directed graph or a multigraph.

    ValueError
        If ``it_limit`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If a node with a non-positive weight is specified.

    KeyError
        If a node does not have the attribute defined by ``weight``.

    Notes
    -----
    This method uses the PartialCol algorithm for node $k$-coloring using
    $k=1$. The set of nodes assigned to this color corresponds to the
    independent set. PartialCol is based on tabu search. Here, each iteration
    of PartialCol has complexity $O(n + m)$. It also occupies $O(n + m)$ of
    memory space.

    The above algorithm is described in detail in [1]_. The c++ code used in
    [1]_ and [2]_ forms the basis of this library's Python implementations.

    This routine will always produce a $k$-coloring. However, this solution

    to occur. The aim is to alter the color assignments so that the number
    of clashes (or the total weight of all clashing edges) is minimized. Each
    iteration of TabuCol has complexity $O(nk + m)$. The process also uses
    $O(nk + m)$ memory.

    If ``weights_at='nodes'``, the PartialCol algorithm is used. This algorithm
    is also based on tabu search and operates using $k$ colors, allowing some
    nodes to be left uncolored. The aim is to make alterations to the color

    -----
    This method first follows the same steps as the :meth:`node_k_coloring`
    method to try and find a node $k$-coloring; however, it also takes node
    weights into account if needed. If a node $k$-coloring is achieved, a
    bespoke local search operator (based on steepest descent) is then used to
    try to reduce the variance in weights across the $k$ color classes. This
    process involves evaluating each Kempe-chain interchange in the current
    solution [1]_ and performing the interchange that results in the largest
    reduction in variance. This process repeats until there are no interchanges
    that reduce the variance. Each iteration of this local search process
    takes $O(n^2)$ time. Further details on this optimization method can be
    found in Chapter 7 of [2], or in [3]_.

    All the above algorithms are described in detail in [2]_. The c++ code used

    algorithm (based on backtracking), or a choice of two polynomial-time
    heuristic algorithms (based on local search). The exact algorithm is
    generally only suitable for larger values of $k$, for graphs that are
    small, or graphs that have topologies suited to its search strategies. In
    all other cases, the local search algorithms are more appropriate.

    If a node $k$-coloring cannot be determined by the algorithm, a
    ``ValueError`` exception is raised. Otherwise, a node $k$-coloring is
    returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The nodes of this graph will be colored.

    k : int
        The number of colors to use.

    opt_alg : None or int, optional (default=None)
        An integer specifying the optimization method that will be used to try
        to reduce the number of colors (if this is seen to be greater than
        $k$). It must be one of the following

        * ``1`` : An exact, exponential-time algorithm based on backtracking.
          The algorithm halts only when the existence of a node $k$-coloring
          has been proved or disproved.
        * ``2`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing adjacent nodes to have the same color.
          Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$ is the number
          of nodes in the graph, $m$ is the number of edges, and $k$ is the
          number of colors in the current solution.
        * ``3`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing nodes to be uncolored. Each iteration
          has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * None : No optimization is performed.

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Only applicable
        when using ``opt_alg=2`` or ``opt_alg=3``.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary with keys representing edges and values representing their
        colors. Colors are identified by the integers $0,1,2,\\ldots,k-1$.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``G`` is a directed graph or a multigraph.

    ValueError
        If ``opt_alg`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``it_limit`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If ``k`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If a clique larger than ``k`` is observed in the graph.

        If a node $k$-coloring could not be determined.

    Notes
    -----
    This method begins by coloring the nodes in the order determined by the
    DSatur algorithm [1]_. During this process, each node is assigned to the
    feasible color class $j$ (where $0 \\leq j \\leq k$) with the fewest nodes.
    This encourages an equitable spread of nodes across the $k$ colors. This
    process has a complexity of $O((n \\lg n) + (nk) + (m \\lg m)$. If a node
    $k$-coloring cannot be achieved in this way, further optimization is
    carried out, if desired. These optimization routines are the same as those
    used by the :meth:`node_coloring` method. They also halt immediately once
    a node $k$-coloring has been achieved.

    All the above algorithms are described in detail in [2]_. The c++ code used
    in [2]_ and [3]_ forms the basis of this library's Python implementations.

def equitable_edge_k_coloring(G, k, weight=None, opt_alg=None, it_limit=0):
    """Attempt to color the edges of a graph using ``k`` colors.

    This is done so that (a) adjacent edges have different colors, and (b) the
    weight of each color class is equal. (A pair of edges is considered
    adjacent if and only if they share a common endpoint.) If ``weight=None``,
    the weight of a color class is the number of edges assigned to that color;
    otherwise, it is the sum of the weights of the edges assigned to that
    color.

    Equivalently, this routine seeks to partition the graph's edges into $k$
    matchings so that the weight of each matching is equal.

    This method first follows the steps used by the :meth:`edge_k_coloring`
    method to try and find an edge $k$-coloring. That is, edge colorings of a
    graph $G$ are determined by forming $G$'s line graph $L(G)$ and then
    passing $L(G)$ to the :meth:`node_k_coloring` method. All parameters are
    therefore the same as the latter. (Note that, if a graph $G=(V,E)$ has $n$
    nodes and $m$ edges, its line graph $L(G)$ will have $m$ nodes and
    $\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{v\\in V}\\deg(v)^2 - m$ edges.)

    If an edge $k$-coloring cannot be determined by the algorithm, a
    ``ValueError`` exception is raised. Otherwise, once an edge $k$-coloring
    has been formed, the algorithm uses a bespoke local search operator to
    reduce the variance in weights across the $k$ colors. In solutions returned
    by this method, adjacent edges always receive different colors; however,
    the coloring is not guaranteed to be equitable, even if an equitable edge
    $k$-coloring exists.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The edges of this graph will be colored.

    k : int
        The number of colors to use.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
        If ``None``, every edge is assumed to have a weight of ``1``. If a
        string, this should correspond to a defined edge attribute. Edge
        weights must be positive.

    opt_alg : None or int, optional (default=None)
        An integer specifying the optimization method that will be used to try

        ``k``). It must be one of the following

        * ``1`` : An exact, exponential-time algorithm based on backtracking.
          The algorithm halts only when the existence of an edge $k$-coloring
          has been proved or disproved.
        * ``2`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing adjacent nodes in $L(G)$ to have the
          same color. Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$
          is the number of nodes in $L(G)$, $m$ is the number of edges in
          $L(G)$, and $k$ is the number of colors in the current solution.

        * None : No optimization is performed.

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Only applicable

    Notes
    -----
    As mentioned, in this implementation edge colorings of a graph $G$ are
    determined by forming $G$'s line graph $L(G)$ and then following the same
    steps as the :meth:`node_k_coloring` method to try and find a node
    $k$-coloring of $L(G)$; however, it also takes edge weights into account
    if needed. If an edge $k$-coloring is achieved, a bespoke local search
    operator (based on steepest descent) is then used to try to reduce the
    variance in weights across the $k$ color classes. This follows the same
    steps as the :meth:`equitable_node_k_coloring` method, using $L(G)$.
    Further details on this optimization method can be found in Chapter 7 of
    [2]_, or in [3]_.

    All the above algorithms are described in detail in [2]_. The c++ code used
    in [2]_ and [4]_ forms the basis of this library's Python implementations.

    equivalent aim is to partition the graph's edges into ``k`` matchings.

    The smallest number of colors needed for coloring the edges of a graph $G$
    is known as the graph's chromatic index, denoted by $\\chi'(G)$.
    Equivalently, $\\chi'(G)$ is the minimum number of matchings needed to
    partition the nodes of a simple graph $G$. According to Vizing's theorem
    [1]_, $\\chi'(G)$ is either $\\Delta(G)$ or $\\Delta(G) + 1$, where
    $\\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree in $G$. The problem of determining an

    A node coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to nodes so that
    adjacent nodes have different colors. The aim is to use as few colors as
    possible. A set of nodes assigned to the same color represents an
    independent set; hence the equivalent aim is to partition the graph's nodes
    into a minimum number of independent sets.

    The smallest number of colors needed to color the nodes of a graph $G$ is
    known as the graph's chromatic number, denoted by $\\chi(G)$. Equivalently,
    $\\chi(G)$ is the minimum number of independent sets needed to partition
    the nodes of $G$.

    Determining a node coloring that minimizes the number of colors is an
    NP-hard problem. This method therefore includes options for using an exact
    exponential-time algorithm (based on backtracking), or a choice of two
    polynomial-time heuristic algorithms (based on local search). The exact
    algorithm is generally only suitable for graphs that are small, or that
    have topologies suited to its search strategies. In all other cases, the
    local search algorithms are more appropriate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The nodes of this graph will be colored.

    strategy : string, optional (default='dsatur')
        A string specifying the method used to generate an initial solution. It
        must be one of the following:

        * ``'random'`` : Randomly orders the graph's nodes and then applies the
          greedy algorithm for graph node coloring [1]_.
        * ``'welsh-powell'`` : Orders the graph's nodes by decreasing degree,
          then applies the greedy algorithm.
        * ``'dsatur'`` : Uses the DSatur algorithm for graph node coloring
          [2]_.
        * ``'rlf'`` : Uses the recursive largest first (RLF) algorithm for
          graph node coloring [3]_.

    opt_alg : None or int, optional (default=None)
        An integer specifying the optimization method that will be used to try
        to reduce the number of colors. It must be one of the following

        * ``1`` : An exact, exponential-time algorithm based on backtracking.
          The algorithm halts only when an optimal solution has been found.
        * ``2`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing adjacent nodes to have the same color.
          Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$ is the number
          of nodes in the graph, $m$ is the number of edges, and $k$ is the
          number of colors in the current solution.
        * 3 : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing nodes to be uncolored. Each iteration
          has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * None : No optimization is performed.

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Only applicable
        when using ``opt_alg=2`` or ``opt_alg=3``.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary with keys representing nodes and values representing their
        colors. Colors are identified by the integers $0,1,2,\\ldots$. The
        number of colors being used in a solution ``c`` is therefore
        ``max(c.values()) + 1``.

        If ``opt_alg`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``it_limit`` is not a nonnegative integer.

    Notes
    -----
    Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, the greedy algorithm
    for node coloring operates in $O(n + m)$ time.

    The ``random`` strategy operates by first randomly permuting the nodes (an
    $O(n)$ operation) before applying the greedy algorithm. It is guaranteed to
    produce a solution with $k \\leq \\Delta(G) + 1$ colors, where
    $\\Delta(G)$ is the highest node degree in the graph $G$.

    The ``welsh-powell`` strategy operates by sorting the nodes by decreasing
    degree (an $O(n \\lg n)$ operation), and then applies the greedy algorithm.
    Its overall complexity is therefore $O(n \\lg n + m)$. Assuming that the
    nodes are labelled $v_1, v_2,\\ldots,v_n$ so that $\\deg(v_1) \\geq
    \\deg(v_2) \\geq \\ldots \\geq \\deg(v_n)$, this method is guaranteed to
    produce a solution with $k \\leq\\max_{i=1,\\ldots,n} \\min(\\deg(v_i)+1,
    i)$ colors. This bound is an improvement on $\\Delta(G) + 1$.

    The ``dsatur`` and ``rlf`` strategies are exact for bipartite, cycle, and
    wheel graphs (that is, solutions with the minimum number of colors are
    guaranteed). The implementation of ``dsatur`` uses a priority queue and has
    a complexity of $O(n \\lg n + m \\lg m)$. The ``rlf`` implementation has a
    complexity of $O(nm)$. In general, the ``rlf`` strategy yields the best
    solutions of the four strategies, though it is computationally more
    expensive. If expense is an issue, then ``dsatur`` is a cheaper alternative
    that also offers high-quality solutions in most cases. See [2]_, [3]_, and
    [4]_ for further information.

    If an optimization algorithm is used, further efforts are made to reduce
    the number of colors. The backtracking approach (``opt_alg=1``) is an
    implementation of the exact algorithm described in [4]_. It has exponential
    runtime and halts only when an optimum solution has been found. At the
    start of execution, a large clique $C\\subseteq V$ is identified using the
    NetworkX function ``max_clique(G)`` and the nodes of $C$ are each assigned
    to a different color. The main backtracking algorithm is then executed and
    only halts only when a solution using $|C|$ colors has been identified, or
    when the algorithm has backtracked to the root of the search tree. In both
    cases the returned solution will be optimal (that is, will be using
    $\\chi(G)$ colors).

    If local search is used (``opt_alg=2`` or ``opt_alg=3``), the algorithm
    removes a color class and uses the chosen local search routine to seek a
    proper coloring using the remaining colors. If this is successful, the
    process repeats. The algorithm is executed until a solution using $|C|$
    colors has been identified (as above), or until the iteration limit is
    reached. Fewer colors (but longer run times) occur with larger iteration
    limits.

    If ``opt_alg=2``, the TabuCol algorithm is used. This algorithm is based
    on tabu search and operates by fixing the number of colors but allowing
    clashes to occur (a clash is the occurrence of two adjacent nodes having
    the same color). The aim is to alter the color assignments so that the
    number of clashes is reduced to zero. Each iteration of TabuCol has
    complexity $O(nk + m)$, where $k$ is the number of colors currently being
    used. The process also uses $O(nk + m)$ memory.

    If ``opt_alg=3``, the PartialCol algorithm is used. This algorithm is also
    based on tabu search and operates by fixing the number of colors but
    allowing some nodes to be left uncolored. The aim is to make alterations
    to the color assignments so that no uncolored nodes remain. As with
    TabuCol, each iteration of PartialCol has complexity $O(nk +m)$ and uses
    $O(nk + m)$ memory.

    All the above algorithms and bounds are described in detail in [4]_. The
    c++ code used in [4]_ and [5]_ forms the basis of this library's Python
    implementations.

    An edge coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to edges so that
    adjacent edges have different colors (a pair of edges is considered
    adjacent if and only if they share a common endpoint). The aim is to use
    as few colors as possible. A set of edges assigned to the same color
    corresponds to a matching; hence the equivalent aim is to partition the
    graph's edges into a minimum number of matchings.

    The smallest number of colors needed for coloring the edges of a graph $G$
    is known as the graph's chromatic index, denoted by $\\chi'(G)$.
    Equivalently, $\\chi'(G)$ is the minimum number of matchings needed to
    partition the nodes of a simple graph $G$. According to Vizing's theorem
    [1]_, $\\chi'(G)$ is either $\\Delta(G)$ or $\\Delta(G) + 1$, where
    $\\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree in $G$.

    Determining an edge coloring that minimizes the number of colors is an
    NP-hard problem. This method therefore includes options for using an

    In this implementation, edge colorings of a graph $G$ are determined by
    forming $G$'s line graph $L(G)$, and then passing $L(G)$ to the
    :meth:`node_coloring` method. All parameters are therefore the same as the
    latter. (Note that, if a graph $G=(V,E)$ has $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, its
    line graph $L(G)$ will have $m$ nodes and $\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{v\\in V}
    \\deg(v)^2 - m$ edges.)

    The chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of colors needed

    """Return a coloring of a graph's nodes where some nodes are precolored.

    A node coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to nodes so that
    adjacent nodes have different colors. The aim is to use as few colors as
    possible. A set of nodes assigned to the same color corresponds to an
    independent set; hence the equivalent aim is to partition the graph's
    nodes into a minimum number of independent sets.

    In the node precoloring problem, some of the nodes have already been
    assigned colors. The aim is to allocate colors to the remaining nodes so
    that we get a full, proper node coloring that uses a minimum number of
    colors. The node precoloring problem can be used to model the Latin square
    completion problem and Sudoku puzzles [1]_.

    The node precoloring problem is NP-hard. This method therefore includes
    options for using an exponential-time exact algorithm (based on
    backtracking), or a choice of two polynomial-time heuristic algorithms
    (based on local search). The exact algorithm is generally only suitable
    for graphs that are small, or that have topologies suited to its search
    strategies. In all other cases, the local search algorithms are more
    appropriate.

    In this implementation, solutions are found by taking all nodes
    pre-allocated to the same color $j$ and merging them into a single
    super-node. Edges are then added between all pairs of super-nodes,
    and the modified graph is passed to the :meth:`node_coloring` method. All
    parameters are therefore the same as the latter. This modification process
    is described in more detail in Chapter 6 of [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The nodes of this graph will be colored.

    precol : None or dict, optional (default=None)
        A dictionary that specifies the (integer) colors of any precolored
        nodes.

    strategy : string, optional (default='dsatur')
        A string specifying the method used to generate the initial solution.
        It must be one of the following:

        * ``'random'`` : Randomly orders the modified graph's nodes and then
          applies the greedy algorithm for graph node coloring [2]_.
        * ``'welsh-powell'`` : Orders the modified graphs nodes by decreasing
          degree, then applies the greedy algorithm.
        * ``'dsatur'`` : Uses the DSatur algorithm for graph node coloring on
          the modified graph [3]_.
        * ``'rlf'`` : Uses the recursive largest first (RLF) algorithm for
          graph node coloring on the modified graph [4]_.

    opt_alg : None or int, optional (default=None)
        An integer specifying the optimization method that will be used to
        try to reduce the number of colors. It must be one of the following

        * ``1`` : An exact, exponential-time algorithm based on backtracking.
          The algorithm halts only when an optimal solution has been found.
        * ``2`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing adjacent nodes to have the same color.
          Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$ is the number
          of nodes in the modified graph, $m$ is the number of edges, and $k$
          is the number of colors in the current solution.
        * ``3`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing nodes to be uncolored. Each iteration
          has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * ``None`` : No optimization is performed.

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Only applicable
        when using ``opt_alg=2`` or ``opt_alg=3``.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary with keys representing nodes and values representing their
        colors. Colors are identified by the integers $0,1,2,\\ldots$. The
        number of colors being used in a solution ``c`` is therefore
        ``max(c.values()) + 1``. If ``precol[v]==j`` then ``c[v]==j``.

    Examples
    --------

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``G`` is a directed graph or a multigraph.

    ValueError
        If ``strategy`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``opt_alg`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``it_limit`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If ``G`` contains a node with the name ``'super'``.

        If ``precol`` contains a node that is not in ``G``.

        If ``precol`` contains a non-integer color label.

        If ``precol`` contains a pair of adjacent nodes assigned the same
        color.

        If ``precol`` uses an integer color label $j$, but there exists a color
        label $0 \\leq i < j$ that is not being used.

    Notes
    -----
    As mentioned, in this implementation, solutions are formed by passing a
    modified version of the graph to :meth:`node_coloring` method. All details
    are therefore the same as those in the latter, where they are documented.

    All the above algorithms and bounds are described in detail in [1]. The c++
    code used in [1]_ and [5]_ forms the basis of this library's Python
    implementations.

        * ``1`` : An exact, exponential-time algorithm based on backtracking.
          The algorithm halts only when an optimal solution has been found.
        * ``2`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing adjacent nodes in $L(G)$ to have the
          same color. Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$ is

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary with keys representing edges and values representing their
        colors. Colors are identified by the integers $0,1,2,\\ldots$. The

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``G`` is a directed graph or a multigraph.

    ValueError
        If ``strategy`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``opt_alg`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``it_limit`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If ``precol`` contains an edge that is not in ``G``.

        If ``precol`` contains a non-integer color label.

        If ``precol`` contains a pair of adjacent edges assigned to the same
        color.

        If ``precol`` uses an integer color label $j$, but there exists a color
        label $0 \\leq i < j$ that is not being used.

    Notes
    -----
    As mentioned, in this implementation, edge colorings of a graph $G$ are
    determined by forming $G$'s line graph $L(G)$ and then passing $L(G)$ to
    the :meth:`node_precoloring` method. All details are therefore the same as
    those in the latter, where they are documented.

    All the above algorithms and bounds are described in detail in [4]_. The
    c++ code used in [4]_ and [5]_ forms the basis of this library's Python
    implementations.
