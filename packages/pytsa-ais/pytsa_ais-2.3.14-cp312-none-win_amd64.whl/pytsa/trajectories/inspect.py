"""
Trajectory Inspector.
====================

This module contains the Inspector class, which is used to filter
trajectories based on a set of rules. The rules are defined in the
:mod:`pytsa.trajectories.rules` module.

The module also contains a set of functions that can be used to
calculate the smoothness and change of course of a navigational
track. These functions can be used as rules in the Inspector class.

    The Inspector is the central class for assessing 
    properties of trajectories, based on a set of 
    rules bundled in a Recipe object. The Inspector
    class applies the rules to a set of target ships
    and returns the accepted and rejected trajectories.
    
    Parameters:
    - data (Targets): A dictionary of TargetShip objects, 
        where the keys are the MMSI numbers of the target 
        ships.
        
    - recipe (Recipe): A Recipe object containing the rules
        to be applied to the trajectories.

#     Calculate the average smoothness of a navigational

#     This function computes the average smoothness of a

#     It evaluates the smoothness based on the angles 
#     formed at each point along the path, where each 
#     angle is determined by a sequence of three consecutive 
#     AISMessage points. The smoothness is a measure of 
#     how straight or curved the path is, with larger 
#     angles indicating a smoother path.

#     The angle at each point is normalized by dividing it 
#     by π, with the function 'angle_between' used to 
#     calculate these angles. Since 'angle_between' returns 
#     values from 0 to π, the normalized angles will range 
#     from 0 (representing a U-turn)  to 1 (representing a 
#     straight line).

#     Parameters:
#     - track (Track): A list of AISMessage objects 
#       representing the navigational path. Each AISMessage 
#       contains positional data necessary for angle calculation.

#     Returns:
#     - float: The average smoothness of the track, 
#       represented as a float. This value is the mean 
#       of the normalized angles along the track, where 
#       a larger values indicates a smoother track.

#     Note:
#     - The function assumes that the track has at least three 
#        AISMessage points to form at least one angle. If the 
#        track has fewer than three points, the behavior of the

    Calculate the average absolute change of course 
    of a navigational track.

    This function computes the average absolute change 
    of course of a path represented by a list of AISMessage 
    objects. It evaluates the change of course based on 
    the angles formed at each point along the path, where 
    each angle is determined by a sequence of three 
    consecutive AISMessage points. The change of course 
    is a measure of how much the path changes direction 
    at each point, with larger angles indicating a greater 
    change of course.

    Parameters:
    - track (Track): A list of AISMessage objects
        representing the navigational path. Each AISMessage 
        contains positional data necessary for angle calculation.
    
    - degrees (bool): A boolean flag indicating whether
        the output should be in degrees or radians. If 
        True, the output will be in degrees; if False, 
        the output will be in radians. The default value 
        is False.

    Returns:
    - float: The average absolute change of course of the 
      track in degrees or radians. This value is the mean 
      of the absolute differences between consecutive 
      normalized angles along the track, where a larger 
      value indicates a greater change of course.
