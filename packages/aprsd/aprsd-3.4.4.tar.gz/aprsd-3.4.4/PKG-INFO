              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

What is APRSD
=============
APRSD is a python application for interacting with the APRS network and providing
APRS services for HAM radio operators.

APRSD currently has 4 main commands to use.
    * server - Connect to APRS and listen/respond to APRS messages
    * webchat - web based chat program over APRS
    * send-message - Send a message to a callsign via APRS_IS.
    * listen - Listen to packets on the APRS-IS Network based on FILTER.

Each of those commands can connect to the APRS-IS network if internet connectivity
is available.  If internet is not available, then APRS can be configured to talk
to a TCP KISS TNC for radio connectivity.

APRSD Overview Diagram
======================

Typical use case
================

APRSD's typical use case is that of providing an APRS wide service to all HAM
radio operators.  For example the callsign 'REPEAT' on the APRS network is actually
an instance of APRSD that can provide a list of HAM repeaters in the area of the
callsign that sent the message.


Ham radio operator using an APRS enabled HAM radio sends a message to check
the weather.  An APRS message is sent, and then picked up by APRSD.  The
APRS packet is decoded, and the message is sent through the list of plugins
for processing.  For example, the WeatherPlugin picks up the message, fetches the weather
for the area around the user who sent the request, and then responds with
the weather conditions in that area.  Also includes a watch list of HAM
callsigns to look out for.  The watch list can notify you when a HAM callsign
in the list is seen and now available to message on the APRS network.



Installation
=============

To install ``aprsd``, use Pip:

``pip install aprsd``

Example usage
==============

``aprsd -h``

Commands
========

Configuration
=============
This command outputs a sample config yml formatted block that you can edit
and use to pass in to ``aprsd`` with ``-c``.  By default aprsd looks in ``~/.config/aprsd/aprsd.yml``

``aprsd sample-config``

::

    └─> aprsd sample-config

server
======

This is the main server command that will listen to APRS-IS servers and
look for incomming commands to the callsign configured in the config file

Web Admin Interface
===================
APRSD has a web admin interface that allows you to view the status of the running APRSD server instance.
The web admin interface shows graphs of packet counts, packet types, number of threads running, the latest
packets sent and received, and the status of each of the plugins that are loaded.  You can also view the logfile
and view the raw APRSD configuration file.

To start the web admin interface, You have to install gunicorn in your virtualenv that already has aprsd installed.

::

  source <path to APRSD's virtualenv>/bin/activate
  aprsd admin --loglevel INFO

The web admin interface will be running on port 8080 on the local machine.  http://localhost:8080


Development
===========

* ``git clone git@github.com:craigerl/aprsd.git``
* ``cd aprsd``
* ``make``

Workflow
--------

While working aprsd, The workflow is as follows:

* Checkout a new branch to work on by running

  ``git checkout -b mybranch``

* Make your changes to the code
* Run Tox with the following options:

  - ``tox -epep8``
  - ``tox -efmt``
  - ``tox -p``

* Commit your changes. This will run the pre-commit hooks which does checks too

  ``git commit``

* Once you are done with all of your commits, then push up the branch to
  github with:

  ``git push -u origin mybranch``

* Create a pull request from your branch so github tests can run and we can do
  a code review.


Release
-------

To do release to pypi:

* Tag release with:

  ``git tag -v1.XX -m "New release"``

* Push release tag:

  ``git push origin master --tags``

* Do a test build and verify build is valid by running:

  ``make build``

* Once twine is happy, upload release to pypi:

  ``make upload``


Building your own APRSD plugins
-------------------------------

APRSD plugins are the mechanism by which APRSD can respond to APRS Messages.  The plugins are loaded at server startup
and can also be loaded at listen startup.  When a packet is received by APRSD, it is passed to each of the plugins
in the order they were registered in the config file.  The plugins can then decide what to do with the packet.
When a plugin is called, it is passed a APRSD Packet object.  The plugin can then do something with the packet and
return a reply message if desired.  If a plugin does not want to reply to the packet, it can just return None.
When a plugin does return a reply message, APRSD will send the reply message to the appropriate destination.

For example, when a 'ping' message is received, the PingPlugin will return a reply message of 'pong'.  When APRSD
receives the 'pong' message, it will be sent back to the original caller of the ping message.

APRSD plugins are simply python packages that can be installed from pypi.org.  They are installed into the
aprsd virtualenv and can be imported by APRSD at runtime.  The plugins are registered in the config file and loaded
at startup of the aprsd server command or the aprsd listen command.

Overview
--------
You can build your own plugins by following the instructions in the `Building your own APRSD plugins`_ section.

Plugins are called by APRSD when packe

Docker Container
================

Building
========

There are 2 versions of the container Dockerfile that can be used.
The main Dockerfile, which is for building the official release container
based off of the pip install version of aprsd and the Dockerfile-dev,
which is used for building a container based off of a git branch of
the repo.

Official Build
==============

``docker build -t hemna6969/aprsd:latest .``

Development Build
=================

``docker build -t hemna6969/aprsd:latest -f Dockerfile-dev .``


Running the container
=====================

There is a ``docker-compose.yml`` file in the ``docker/`` directory
that can be used to run your container. To provide the container
an ``aprsd.conf`` configuration file, change your
``docker-compose.yml`` as shown below:

::

     volumes:
         - $HOME/.config/aprsd:/config

To install plugins at container start time, pass in a list of
comma-separated list of plugins on PyPI using the ``APRSD_PLUGINS``
environment variable in the ``docker-compose.yml`` file. Note that
version constraints may also be provided. For example:

::

    environment:
        - APRSD_PLUGINS=aprsd-slack-plugin>=1.0.2,aprsd-twitter-plugin
