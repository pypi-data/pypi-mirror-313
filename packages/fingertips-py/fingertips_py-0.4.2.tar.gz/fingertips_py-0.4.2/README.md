# fingertips_py

This is a python package to interact with OHID's 
[Fingertips](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/) data tool. Fingertips is a 
major repository of population and public health indicators for England.
The site presents the information in many ways to improve accessibility 
for a wide range of audiences ranging from public health professionals 
and researchers to the general public. The information presented is a 
mixture of data available from other public sources, and those that are 
available through user access agreements with other organisations. The 
source of each indicator presented is available using the 
 `get_metadata_for_indicator()` function.
 
 
This package can be used to load data from the Fingertips API into 
python for further use.
 
## Installation
 
This packaged should be installed using pip:

```
pip install fingertips_py
``` 

Or it can be compiled from source (still requires pip):

```
pip install git+https://github.com/PublicHealthEngland/PHDS_fingertips_py.git
```

## Usage

fingertips_py should be imported and used in line with standard python
conventions. It is suggested that if the whole package is to be imported
 then the following convention is used:
 
```
import fingertips_py as ftp
```

The package returns data in a variety of types dependent on the 
function. 

For more information on any function, you can use:

```
help(*fingertips_py function name*)
```

Or you can view the documents [here](https://fingertips-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Example

This is an example of a workflow for retrieving data for the indicator 
on *Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth* from the *Public Health Outcomes 
Framework* profile. 

```
import fingertips_py as ftp


phof = ftp.get_profile_by_name('public health outcomes framework')
phof_meta = ftp.get_metadata_for_profile_as_dataframe(phof['Id'])
indicator_meta = phof_meta[phof_meta['Indicator'].str.contains('Healthy')]
print(indicator_meta)

    Indicator ID                                          Indicator  ...   
0          90362            0.1i - Healthy life expectancy at birth  ... 
55         92543  2.05ii - Proportion of children aged 2-2Â½yrs r...  ...
```

We can see that the *Healthy life expectancy at birth* indicator has an 
id of 90362. The data for this indicator at all geographical breakdowns 
can be retrieved using `get_data_for_indicator_at_all_available_geographies()`

```
healthy_life_data = ftp.get_data_for_indicator_at_all_available_geographies(90362)
```
