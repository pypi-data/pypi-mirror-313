## Typing stubs for seaborn

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`seaborn`](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
[Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses `seaborn`. This version of
`types-seaborn` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`seaborn==0.13.2`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/seaborn`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/seaborn)
directory.

This package was tested with
mypy 1.13.0,
pyright 1.1.389,
and pytype 2024.10.11.
It was generated from typeshed commit
[`7fbb5fe32ba3d92ba51d9e06837b48895cf5f038`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/7fbb5fe32ba3d92ba51d9e06837b48895cf5f038).
