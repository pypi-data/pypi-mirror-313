# WhatsApp Flows Guide

This guide outlines the steps to create and manage WhatsApp flows using the Meta Developers platform. There are two types of WhatsApp flows:

1. **Flows with Endpoints:** These flows interact with external APIs to fetch or send dynamic data.
2. **Flows without Endpoints:** These flows operate independently and do not require external API interactions.

In this guide, we'll focus on creating a WhatsApp flow app **without endpoints**. Follow the steps below to set up your flow and deploy it successfully.

---

## Steps to Create a WhatsApp Flow App Without Endpoints

### 1. Create an App on Meta Developers Account
To begin, create an app on the [Meta Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) platform. This app will serve as the foundation for managing your WhatsApp flows.

---

### 2. Add a Phone Number
Add a phone number to your app. This number will be associated with your WhatsApp Business account and used for sending and receiving messages.

---

### 3. Enable Messaging Permissions
Ensure your app has the necessary messaging permissions enabled for interacting with WhatsApp messaging features.

---

### 4. Create a Business on Meta Business Account
Create a business account on [Meta Business](https://business.facebook.com/). This links your WhatsApp Business with your Meta Developers app.

---

### 5. Verify Your Business
Complete the verification process for your business to gain access to additional features and permissions.

---

### 6. Request Advanced Permissions
Request the following advanced permissions for your Meta Developers app:

- **`whatsapp_business_management`**: Manage WhatsApp Business accounts, including creating flows.
- **`whatsapp_business_messaging`**: Send and receive messages via the WhatsApp Business API.
- **`whatsapp_business_phone_number`**: Access WhatsApp Business phone numbers.
- **`business_management`**: Manage business assets like ad accounts and pages.
- **`pages_messaging`**: Optional if flows interact with Facebook Pages for messaging.

---

### 7. Obtain Necessary Credentials
Gather the following credentials from your Meta Developers account. These will configure your WhatsApp flows:

```plaintext
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_VERIFY_TOKEN
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID
```

---

### 8. Create a Flow on Flow Development Playground
Design your WhatsApp flow using the [Flow Development Playground](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/playground/).

To create a flow programmatically:

```python
from whatsapp_flows import FlowsManager
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

flows_manager = FlowsManager(
    whatsapp_access_token=os.getenv("WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN"),
    whatsapp_account_id=os.getenv("WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID"),
    whatsapp_phone_number_id=os.getenv("WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID"),
)

try:
    response = flows_manager.create_flow(flow_name="TEST FLOW")
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

---

### 9. Deploy the Middleware/Webhook
Deploy the middleware or webhook to handle flow execution.

---

### 10. Configure the Webhook URL
Configure the webhook URL in your Meta Developers account. This links your flow to WhatsApp messaging.

---

### 11. Create and Manage Flows

#### Listing Flows:
```python
try:
    response = flows_manager.list_flows()
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

#### Getting Flow Details:
```python
try:
    response = flows_manager.get_flow_details(flow_id="1234567890")
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

---

### 12. Upload Your Flow JSON
Upload your flow JSON using the Flow Development Playground or programmatically:

```python
SYSTEM_PATH = os.getcwd()
FLOW_JSON_FILE_PATH = os.path.join(SYSTEM_PATH, "data/flow.json")

try:
    response = flows_manager.upload_flow_json(
        flow_id="1234567890", flow_file_path=FLOW_JSON_FILE_PATH
    )
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

---

### 13. Test Your Flow
Test your flow programmatically:

```python
try:
    response = flows_manager.simulate_flow(flow_id="1234567890")
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

---

### 14. Publish Your Flow
Publish your flow:

```python
try:
    response = flows_manager.publish_flow(flow_id="1234567890")
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

---

### 15. Sending Published and Unpublished Flows

#### Send a Published Flow:
```python
try:
    response = flows_manager.send_published_flow(
        flow_id="1234567890",
        flow_cta_header_text="Amazing Shop!!",
        flow_cta_body_text="Hello, welcome to our general shop!!",
        flow_cta_footer_text="Click the button to continue.",
        flow_cta_button_text="START SHOPPING",
        recipient_phone_number="255753456789"
    )
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

#### Send an Unpublished Flow:
```python
try:
    response = flows_manager.send_unpublished_flow(
        flow_id="1234567890",
        flow_cta_header_text="Amazing Shop!!",
        flow_cta_body_text="Hello, welcome to our general shop!!",
        flow_cta_footer_text="Click the button to continue.",
        flow_cta_button_text="START SHOPPING",
        recipient_phone_number="255753456789"
    )
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

---

### 16. Update or Delete Flows

#### Update Flow JSON:
```python
try:
    response = flows_manager.update_flow_json(
        flow_id="1234567890", flow_file_path=FLOW_JSON_FILE_PATH
    )
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

#### Delete a Flow:
```python
try:
    response = flows_manager.delete_flow(flow_id="1234567890")
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

## Full Examples WhatsApp Flows Management Guide

## Prerequisite Setup

Before performing any actions, each script follows a similar setup:
- Import necessary libraries (`os`, `dotenv`, `whatsapp_flows`)
- Load environment variables using `load_dotenv()`
- Set up environment variables for:
  - `WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`
  - `WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  - `WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID`
- Initialize `FlowsManager` with these credentials

```python

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from whatsapp_flows import FlowsManager

load_dotenv()

WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID = os.getenv("WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID")
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN = os.getenv("WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN")
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID = os.getenv("WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID")


flows_manager = FlowsManager(
    whatsapp_access_token=WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    whatsapp_account_id=WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID,
    whatsapp_phone_number_id=WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID,
)

```

## Flow Management Actions

### 1. Creating a Flow
```python
flows_manager.create_flow(flow_name="TEST FLOW")
```
- Initiates a new WhatsApp flow with a specified name
- Returns flow creation response
- Useful for starting a new conversational flow or interaction

### 2. Getting Flow Details
```python
flows_manager.get_flow_details(flow_id="1234567890")
```
- Retrieves comprehensive information about a specific flow
- Requires a valid flow ID
- Helpful for checking flow configuration and status

### 3. Listing All Flows
```python
flows_manager.list_flows()
```
- Fetches a list of all existing flows
- Provides an overview of current flows in the WhatsApp Business account
- Useful for management and tracking

### 4. Updating Flow Name
```python
flows_manager.update_flow(
    flow_id="1234567890", 
    new_flow_name="NEW FLOW NAME"
)
```
- Allows renaming an existing flow
- Requires flow ID and new name
- Helpful for organizing and clarifying flow purposes

### 5. Uploading Flow JSON
```python
flows_manager.upload_flow_json(
    flow_id="1234567890", 
    flow_file_path="data/flow.json"
)
```
- Uploads a JSON configuration for a specific flow
- Requires flow ID and path to JSON file
- Used to define or modify flow structure and logic

### 6. Getting Flow Assets
```python
flows_manager.get_flow_assets(flow_id="1234567890")
```
- Retrieves all assets associated with a flow
- Includes JSON configurations and related resources
- Useful for auditing or backing up flow configurations

### 7. Publishing Flow
```python
flows_manager.publish_flow(flow_id="1234567890")
```
- Makes a flow live and ready for use
- Finalizes flow configuration
- **Important**: Once published, flow cannot be directly updated or deleted

### 8. Simulating Flow on Web
```python
flows_manager.simulate_flow(flow_id="1234567890")
```
- Provides a web-based simulation of the flow
- Helps test and preview flow behavior before actual deployment
- Useful for debugging and validation

### 9. Sending Unpublished Flow
```python
flows_manager.send_unpublished_flow(
    flow_id="1234567890",
    flow_cta_header_text="Amazing Shop!!",
    flow_cta_body_text="Welcome to our shop!",
    flow_cta_footer_text="Click to continue",
    flow_cta_button_text="START SHOPPING",
    recipient_phone_number="255753456789"
)
```
- Sends a flow that hasn't been published
- Allows testing flows with specific messaging parameters
- Requires detailed call-to-action (CTA) texts and recipient number

### 10. Sending Published Flow
```python
flows_manager.send_published_flow(
    flow_id="1234567890",
    # Similar parameters to unpublished flow
)
```
- Sends a flow that has been officially published
- Similar to unpublished flow sending, but for live flows

### 11. Updating Flow JSON
```python
flows_manager.update_flow_json(
    flow_id="1234567890", 
    flow_file_path="data/flow.json"
)
```
- Modifies the JSON configuration of a flow
- Requires flow ID and updated JSON file path
- Used to make configuration changes

### 12. Deprecating Flow
```python
flows_manager.deprecate_flow(flow_id="1234567890")
```
- Marks a published flow as deprecated
- Prevents further use without deleting historical data
- Recommended method for retiring published flows

### 13. Deleting Flow
```python
flows_manager.delete_flow(flow_id="1234567890")
```
- Removes an unpublished flow
- Cannot be used on published flows
- Permanently deletes flow configuration

## Key Considerations
- Always use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- Handle exceptions to manage potential errors
- Published flows have limited modification options
- Use simulation and careful testing before publishing
