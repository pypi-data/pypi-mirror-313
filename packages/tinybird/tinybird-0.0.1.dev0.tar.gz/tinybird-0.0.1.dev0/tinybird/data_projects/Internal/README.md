# Internal data project

This repository contains the basic datasources and pipes required for our "Internal" workspace.

You can find some information about how to work with this internal data project in [this wiki section](https://wiki.tinybird.co/doc/internal-data-project-rerSF0GFuA). You can find there:
- How to initially configure this data project in a new Tinybird region.
- A few comments about how to iterate this particular project as it's a bit special right now.

If you are new to this way of iterating data projects with Versions, we have some documentation that may be useful:
- The [public guides](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/production/working-with-version-control) with a deep down exploration of how version control works.
- The [Use Cases](https://github.com/tinybirdco/use-case-examples) repository where you can find detailed instructions about how to do different iterations in a data project.
