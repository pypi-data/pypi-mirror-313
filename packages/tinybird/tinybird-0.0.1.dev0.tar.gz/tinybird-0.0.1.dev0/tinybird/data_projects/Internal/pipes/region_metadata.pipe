DESCRIPTION >
    This pipe has no description due to a bug with `tb diff`, which always
    reports differences when a description is present before the include. This
    is the description that should be in the pipe:
    This pipe is only made up of single-value nodes that are set using include
    datafiles and environment variables. It contains relevant metadata of the
    region in which this workspace is hosted.
    This node should select * from all the included nodes, cross-joined.

SQL >
    select * from orb_billing_region
