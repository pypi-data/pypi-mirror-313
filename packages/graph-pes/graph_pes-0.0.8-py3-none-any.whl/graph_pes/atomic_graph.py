class AtomicGraph(NamedTuple):
    # special members of other: cutoff, batch, ptr
    r"""
    An :class:`AtomicGraph` represents an atomic structure.
    Each node corresponds to an atom, and each directed edge links a central
    atom to a "bonded" neighbour.

    We implement such graphs as (immutable) :class:`~typing.NamedTuple`\ s.
    This allows for easy serialisation and compatibility with PyTorch,
    TorchScript and other libraries. These objects, and all functions that
    operate on them, are compatible with both isolated and periodic structures.

    Batches of multiple structures are represented by a single
    :class:`AtomicGraph` object containing multiple disjoint subgraphs. See
    :func:`~graph_pes.atomic_graph.to_batch` for more information.

    Properties
    ++++++++++

    Below we assume the graph contains ``N`` atoms, ``E`` edges (and ``S``
    structures if the graph is batched).

    We use two examples to illustrate the various properties:


    .. dropdown:: Water molecule

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> from ase.build import molecule
            >>> from load_atoms import view
            >>> water = molecule("H2O")
            >>> view(water, show_bonds=True)

        .. raw:: html
            :file: ../../docs/source/_static/water.html

        We can see that there are 3 atoms, with 2 bonds (and therefore 4
        directed edges):

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> from graph_pes import AtomicGraph
            >>> water_graph = AtomicGraph.from_ase(water, cutoff=1.2)
            >>> water_graph
            AtomicGraph(atoms=3, edges=4, has_cell=False, cutoff=1.2)

    .. dropdown:: Sodium crystal

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> from ase.build import bulk
            >>> from load_atoms import view
            >>> sodium = bulk("Na")
            >>> view(sodium.repeat(3), show_bonds=True)

        .. raw:: html
            :file: ../../docs/source/_static/Na.html

        This structure has a single atom within a periodic cell. If you
        look closely, you can see that this atom has 8 nearest neighbours.
        Only "source" atoms within the unit cell are included in the
        neighbour list, and hence there are 8 edges:

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> sodium_graph = AtomicGraph.from_ase(sodium, cutoff=3.7)
