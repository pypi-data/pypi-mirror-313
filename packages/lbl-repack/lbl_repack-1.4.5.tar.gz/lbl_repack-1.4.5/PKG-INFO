This code identifies the strong lines that dominate the spectrum from
the large-majority of weaker lines.  The code returns a binary
line-by-line (LBL) file with the strong lines info (wavenumber, Elow,
gf, and isotope ID), and an ascii file with the combined contribution
of the weaker lines compressed into a continuum extinction coefficient
(in cm-1 amagat-1) as function of wavenumber and temperature.

Currently available databases:
* ExoMol (http://www.exomol.com/)
* HITRAN (https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/)
* Kurucz's TiO (http://kurucz.harvard.edu/molecules/tio)

### Install
``repack`` has been [tested](https://travis-ci.com/pcubillos/repack) to work on Python 3.6 and 3.7; and runs (at least) in both Linux and OSX.  You can install ``repack`` from the terminal with pip:

```shell
# Note that on PyPI ``repack``is indexed as ``lbl-repack``:
pip install lbl-repack
```

### Getting Started

The following example compresses the Exomol HCN line-transition data.  First, download the ExoMol HCN dataset (there is no need to unzip the files):

```shell
# Download ExoMol HCN data:
wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-12C-14N/Harris/1H-12C-14N__Harris.states.bz2
wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-12C-14N/Harris/1H-12C-14N__Harris.trans.bz2
wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-12C-14N/Harris/1H-12C-14N__Harris.pf
wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-13C-14N/Larner/1H-13C-14N__Larner.states.bz2
wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-13C-14N/Larner/1H-13C-14N__Larner.trans.bz2
wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-13C-14N/Larner/1H-13C-14N__Larner.pf
```

Then create a repack configuration file ('*repack_HCN.cfg*') like this below:

```shell
[REPACK]

# Line-transition files:
lblfiles = 1H-12C-14N__Harris.trans.bz2
           1H-13C-14N__Larner.trans.bz2

# Database type [exomol, hitran, or kurucz]:
dbtype = exomol

# Output file name (without file extension):
outfile = HCN_exomol_harris-larner_0.3-33um_100-3000K_sthresh_0.01

# Wavenumber boundaries and sampling rate (in cm-1):
wnmin =   303.0
wnmax = 33334.0
dwn   =     1.0

# Temperature sampling:
tmin  =  100.0
tmax  = 3000.0
dtemp =  100.0

# Line-intensity threshold for strong/weak lines:
sthresh = 0.01

# Maximum chunk size of lines to handle at a time:
chunksize = 5000000
ncpu = 5
```

And run ``repack``:
```shell
repack repack_H2O.cfg
```

which will produce the following screen output:
```shell
# Call the repack command-line executable for the HCN demo config file:
repack repack_HCN.cfg

Successfully rewriten exomol line-transition info into:

```

The output binary file '*HCN_exomol_harris-larner_0.3-33um_100-3000K_sthresh_0.01_lbl.dat*'
contains the line-by-line opacity information for HCN, which represent
most of the opacity contribution into the spectrum.  The information
is encoded as a sequence of three doubles and an integer containing
the wavenumber (in cm-1), lower-state energy (in cm-1 units),
gf value, and isotope index, respectively, for each transition.  This
info can be easily read with the following python script:

```python
import repack.utils as u
wn, elow, gf, iiso = u.read_lbl('HCN_exomol_harris-larner_0.3-33um_100-3000K_sthresh_0.01_lbl.dat')
```

The output ascii file '*HCN_exomol_harris-larner_0.3-33um_100-3000K_sthresh_0.01_continuum.dat*'
contains the remaining opacity contribution of the weak lines (in cm-1
amagat-1 units) as function of wavenumber and temperature.  This is a
minor contribution compared to that of the LBL output file.


### Re-sorting MARVELized files

Since some ExoMol .states files have been MARVELized (refined energy levels), the .trans files are no longer sorted by wavenumber.  This is a problem for ``repack`` since its binaary searches rely on a sorted wavenumber files.  To solve this, the user should sort the files before repacking:

```shell
# First sort the .trans files (use same config file as a repack file):
repack -sort repack_H2O.cfg

# Now run repack as usual:
repack repack_H2O.cfg
```
