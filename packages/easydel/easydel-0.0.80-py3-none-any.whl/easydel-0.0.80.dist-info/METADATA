## Key Components

### vInference

The `vInference` class provides a streamlined interface for text generation using pre-trained language models within JAX.

```python
import easydel as ed
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

model, params = ed.AutoEasyDeLModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(...)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(...)

inference = ed.vInference(
	model=model,
	params=params,
	tokenizer=tokenizer,
	generation_config=ed.vInferenceConfig(
		temperature=model.generation_config.temperature,
		top_k=model.generation_config.top_k,
		top_p=model.generation_config.top_p,
		bos_token_id=model.generation_config.bos_token_id,
		eos_token_id=model.generation_config.eos_token_id,
		pad_token_id=model.generation_config.pad_token_id,
		streaming_chunks=32,
		max_new_tokens=1024,
	),
)
```

### vInferenceApiServer 

`vInferenceApiServer` is a Serve API Engine for production or research purposes, providing a stable, efficient, and OpenAI API like API.

```python
import easydel as ed

api_inference = ed.vInferenceApiServer(
	{inference.inference_name: inference}
)  # you can load multi inferences together
api_inference.fire()
```

### EasyDeLState

`EasyDeLState` acts as a comprehensive container for your EasyDeL model, including training progress, model parameters, and optimizer information.

```python
from easydel import EasyDeLState

state = EasyDeLState.from_pretrained(
    pretrained_model_name_or_path="model_name",
    dtype=jnp.bfloat16,
    param_dtype=jnp.bfloat16,
    sharding_axis_dims=(1, -1, 1, 1)
)
```

## Training Examples

### Supervised Fine-Tuning

```python
from easydel import SFTTrainer, TrainingArguments

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    arguments=train_arguments,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    formatting_func=prompter,
    packing=True,
    num_of_sequences=max_length,
)

output = trainer.train(flax.core.FrozenDict({"params": params}))
```

### DPO Fine-tuning

```python
from easydel import DPOTrainer

dpo_trainer = DPOTrainer(
    model_state=state,
    ref_model_state=ref_state,
    beta=0.1,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    arguments=arguments,
    max_length=max_length,
    max_completion_length=max_completion_length,
