"""
A collection of regular expressions (regex patterns) for common data validation tasks across a variety of fields, including usernames, passwords, emails, phone numbers, zip codes, addresses, credit cards, IP addresses, and dates.

Each regex pattern is tailored to match specific requirements, making it easy to validate inputs that meet common standards and constraints. The module includes patterns for the following categories:

1. **Username**: Patterns for validating usernames with varying rules, such as minimum length, allowed characters, and format restrictions (e.g., starting with a letter, containing only letters and numbers, or disallowing special characters at the start/end).

2. **Password**: Patterns for validating passwords with constraints on length, complexity (e.g., containing uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters), and other criteria such as disallowing whitespace or consecutive characters.

3. **Email**: Patterns for validating emails with different levels of strictness, allowing or disallowing subdomains, Unicode characters, and enforcing specific formats in line with RFC 5322.

4. **Phone Number**: Patterns for validating phone numbers in various formats, including U.S. standard, international format, and phone numbers with extensions.

5. **Zip Code**: Patterns for validating postal codes for specific regions, including the U.S. and U.K.

6. **Address**: Patterns for validating address formats with requirements such as including a street number, street name, and potentially city/state/ZIP.

7. **Credit Card**: Patterns for validating credit card numbers across various providers (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, American Express) and formats (e.g., with or without spaces/dashes).

8. **IP Address**: Patterns for validating IP addresses in both IPv4 and IPv6 formats, with options for including port numbers.

9. **Date**: Patterns for validating date formats commonly used around the world, such as YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, and DD-MM-YYYY.

Each regex pattern is accompanied by a description of the criteria it enforces and examples of inputs that would match or fail to match.
