Then, based on the query, I will select a few chunks that best reflect the company’s\ndevelopment trends. Finally, I will summarize the company's development trends over the past two years based on the information from the selected chunks.\n2.Graph: To build and use graph-type knowledge, I need to present the information from the documents in the form of a graph, with the company name as the head node, financial metrics as the relationships, and c\norresponding financial data as the tail nodes. Then, I will find the relevant company and subgraph based on the query and summarize the company's development trends over the past two years based on the informa\ntion in the subgraph.\n3.Table: To build and use table-type knowledge, I need to present the information from the documents in table form, with the company name as the rows and various financial metrics as the columns. The value in e\nach cell will be the corresponding financial data. Finally, I will summarize the company's development trends over the past two years based on the information in the table.\n4.Algorithm: To build and use algorithm-type knowledge, I need to use the company’s metrics as judgment criteria, with each decision in the process determining whether to consider the information from that metr\nic. Ultimately, I will summarize the company's development trends based on this process.\n5.Catalogue: To build and use catalogue-type knowledge, I need to classify the company’s different financial metrics by importance. Each level of the directory will include specific information about the metric, an\nd I will draw conclusions based on all the metric information in this catalogue.\n########\nQuery:\n{{query}}\nOutput:",
