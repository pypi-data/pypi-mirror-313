This repository contains only the annotations and URL list of the FindingEmo dataset, reported in the paper
["FindingEmo: A Picture Dataset for Emotion Recognition in the Wild"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01355) by Laurent Mertens et al.,
accepted at the [NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track](https://nips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/97871).

If you also require the code, please visit [https://gitlab.com/EAVISE/lme/findingemo](https://gitlab.com/EAVISE/lme/findingemo) instead.

## <a name="obtaining_images"></a>Obtaining the annotated images
### Solution 1: Using the PyPi package
Install the FindingEmo-Light package:
```
pip install findingemo-light
```
Then, in a Python script, do
```python
from findingemo_light.paper.download_multi import download_data

download_data(target_dir='./Path/To/Where/You/Want/To/Download/The/Images')
```
To get the annotations, use
```python
from findingemo_light.data.read_annotations import read_annotations

ann_data = read_annotations()
print(ann_data)
```

### Solution 2: Using the codebase
Clone the repository locally, execute ```paper/download_multi.py``` and save images to ```Config.DIR_IMAGES```
(which is the default save location).

The annotations are located under ```data/annotations_single.ann```.

## Logo
The ```./data/Logo``` folder contains image files with the dataset logo in various formats. If you find this data useful,
feel free to use the logo on your poster.

## Dataset
The <u><b>annotations</b></u> are stored in the [```data/annotations_single.ann```](findingemo_light/data/annotations_single.ann) file, which is a simple text file in CSV format.
The [```data/dataset_urls_exploded.json```](findingemo_light/data/dataset_urls_exploded.json) file contains the <u><b>URLs for the annotated images</b></u>, with multiple URLs provided
for a large number of images. We intend to update this file as we obtain backup URLs for more images.

A <u><b>Croissant metadata</b></u> file is also included ([```./croissant-findingemo.json```](./croissant-findingemo.json) to allow loading the dataset through the [Croissant](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant) framework.

Dataset <u><b>documentation</b></u> can be found at [```datasheet/datasheet.md```](findingemo_light/datasheet/datasheet.md).

## Data overview
The ```data``` folder contains the CSV/TXT files containing the results per experiment used to generate the results
reported in the paper.

The ```data/Logo``` folder contains image files with the dataset logo.

The ```annotations_single.ann``` file, which is a simple text file in CSV format, contains the image annotations.

The ```dataset_urls_exploded.json``` file is the extended version of ```dataset_urls.txt```, which list multiple URLs for a
number of images, and is used by the ```paper/download_multi.py``` script.
