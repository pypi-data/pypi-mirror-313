A powerful, enterprise-grade multi-agent system for advanced radiological analysis, diagnosis, and treatment planning. This system leverages specialized AI agents working in concert to provide comprehensive medical imaging analysis and care recommendations.

## üåü Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents working together for comprehensive analysis
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: HIPAA-compliant data handling and processing
- **Standardized Reporting**: Follows ACR guidelines and structured reporting frameworks
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in QA processes and verification steps
- **Comprehensive Workflow**: From image analysis to treatment planning
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Designed for high-volume clinical environments

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of six specialized agents:

1. **Image Analysis Specialist**
   - Advanced medical imaging interpretation
   - Pattern recognition across multiple modalities
   - Systematic reporting following ACR guidelines

2. **Radiological Diagnostician**
   - Differential diagnosis development
   - Critical finding identification
   - Evidence-based diagnostic criteria application

3. **Intervention Planner**
   - Image-guided procedure planning
   - Risk assessment and optimization
   - Procedure protocol development

4. **Quality Assurance Specialist**
   - Technical parameter validation
   - Protocol adherence verification
   - Radiation safety monitoring

5. **Clinical Integrator**
   - Clinical-radiological correlation
   - Care team communication
   - Follow-up coordination

6. **Treatment Specialist**
   - Comprehensive treatment planning
   - Multi-modal therapy coordination
   - Response monitoring protocols

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install radiology-swarm
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from radiology_swarm.main import run_diagnosis_agents

# Simple analysis with default parameters
result = run_diagnosis_agents(
    prompt="Analyze this image and provide an analysis and then a treatment",
    img="xray.jpeg"
)

# Advanced usage with custom parameters
result = run_diagnosis_agents(
    prompt="Detailed chest X-ray analysis with focus on cardiac silhouette",
    img="chest_xray.dcm",
    modality="xray",
    priority="urgent",
    previous_studies=["previous_xray.dcm"],
    clinical_context={
        "symptoms": ["chest pain", "shortness of breath"],
        "history": "Previous MI"
    }
)
```
