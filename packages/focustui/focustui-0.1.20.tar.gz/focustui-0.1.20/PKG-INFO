### Needed Tools
#### For Windows:

1. **Python Installation:**
   -  If you don’t have it installed, download Python from the official [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - During installation, make sure to check the checkbox that says **“Add Python to PATH”**.
2. **Install `Scoop`:**
   - Scoop is a command-line installer for Windows. If you don’t have it installed, follow the instructions on the
     Scoop official [website](https://scoop.sh).
3. **Install `pipx`:**
```bash
scoop install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

#### For macOS:

1. **Install `Homebrew`:**
	- Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. If you don’t have it installed, follow the instructions on the
     Homebrew official [website](https://brew.sh/).
2. **Install `pipx`:**
```bash
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

#### For Linux:
1. **Install `pipx`:**
   - Install pipx using your package [manager](https://github.com/pypa/pipx?tab=readme-ov-file#on-linux).

### FocusTUI Installation (every OS)
Once you have `pipx` installed, you can easily install `FocusTUI`:

1. **Install `FocusTUI`:**
```bash
pipx install focustui
```

### Run the App
After installation, you can start `FocusTUI` by typing:
```bash
focustui
```

Note for macOS users: The first time you open the app, it may take up to 1 minute.
I’m not sure why, but during this initial launch, the app creates
folders, files, a database, and moves sounds to the app folder. This delay only
happens on the first launch. Apologies for the inconvenience.
