# Logger Package for PathwaysGI

This is a custom wrapper for the `logging` package in Python. It includes custom formatters and handlers to log messages to the console and to a file.

This can be added to a poetry project via a `pyproject.toml` file. The following is an example of how to add this package to a poetry project.

```toml {"id":"01J313KMJJY4M788DVY919FG65"}
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
pgi-logging = {git = "https://bitbucket.org/pathwaysgi/pgi-logging.git", branch = "master"}

```

To add the repo as a development dependency, clone the repo to the parent directory of your project and use the following command:

```toml {"id":"01J313QTVPH0QVRFKX2JEJ64FG"}
[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pgi-logging = { path = "../pgi-logging", develop = true }
```
