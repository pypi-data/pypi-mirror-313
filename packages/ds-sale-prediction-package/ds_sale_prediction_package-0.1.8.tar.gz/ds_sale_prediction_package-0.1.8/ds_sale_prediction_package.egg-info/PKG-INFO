# ds_sales_prediction_package

The package is designed to optimize the machine learning pipeline for time-series sales prediction task  for the Kaggle competition **Predict Future Sales**. It includes the following key components:

**DataPreparation**
Prepares a combined dataset from both training and test data.
    - Processes training data after DQL and EDA steps. It includes target
    value clipping, dataset expansion using a Cartesian product, and base
    feature selection.
    - Processes test data by assigning the `date_block_num` value equal 34
    and merges it
    with the preprocessed train data.
    - Optimizes data types based on feature values to reduce memory usage.

**FeatureExtractor**
Generates a diverse set of features to enhance predictive model performance.
    - Descriptive features: (e.g. item_category_id, city, shop_type,
    shop_cluster_umap, shop_cluster_pca)
    from dict based on csv files (items, and train dataset after EDA)
    - One-hot encoded features (item_category_id).
    - TF-IDF encoded features (shop_type).
    - Binary features (e.g. is_moscow)
    - Time-based features (e.g., months_since_last_sale,
    months_since_first_sale).
    - Lag features, including lagged item_cnt_month and item_price

**ModelValidator**
Facilitates model validation and training using time-series cross-validation.
    - Split the dataset into training and validation sets based on
    time-series cross-validation with either expanding or sliding windows.
    - Train and evaluate models across multiple folds, calculating RMSE
    for both training and validation sets.
    - Retrain the model on the combined training and validation data, and
    make predictions on the test set.

**ExplainabilityLayer**
Explains the results of model predictions through various plots.
    - Supports various scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models.
    - Includes tools for error analysis, visualizing true vs. predicted values, and identifying patterns in residuals.

**optimize_model**
Utilizes hyperopt for hyperparameter optimization, enabling efficient model tuning to achieve optimal performance.
