# icplot

This project is a utility library used at ICHEC for generating plots and graphics for use in technical documents.

# Installation #

The package is available on PyPI. For a minimal installation you can do:

``` shell
pip install icplot
```

For full functionality, particularly for conversion of image formats `imagemagick` and `cairo` are required. On Mac you can install them with:

``` shell
brew install imagemagick cairo
```

To covert between image formats you can do:

``` shell
icplot convert --source my_image.svg --target my_image.png
```

To render a Tex tikz image as pdf and png you can do:

``` shell
