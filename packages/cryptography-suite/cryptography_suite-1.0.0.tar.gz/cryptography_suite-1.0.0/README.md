## 💡 Usage Examples

### Symmetric Encryption

Encrypt and decrypt messages using AES-GCM with password-derived keys.

```python
from cryptography_suite.encryption import aes_encrypt, aes_decrypt

message = "Highly Confidential Information"
password = "ultra_secure_password"

# Encrypt the message
encrypted_message = aes_encrypt(message, password)
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted_message}")

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_message = aes_decrypt(encrypted_message, password)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted_message}")
```

### Asymmetric Encryption

Generate RSA key pairs and perform encryption/decryption.

```python
from cryptography_suite.asymmetric import generate_rsa_keypair, rsa_encrypt, rsa_decrypt

# Generate RSA key pair
private_key, public_key = generate_rsa_keypair()

message = b"Secure Data Transfer"

# Encrypt the message
encrypted_message = rsa_encrypt(message, public_key)
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted_message}")

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_message = rsa_decrypt(encrypted_message, private_key)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted_message}")
```

### Digital Signatures

Sign and verify messages using Ed25519.

```python
from cryptography_suite.signatures import generate_ed25519_keypair, sign_message, verify_signature

# Generate key pair
private_key, public_key = generate_ed25519_keypair()

message = b"Authenticate this message"

# Sign the message
signature = sign_message(message, private_key)

# Verify the signature
is_valid = verify_signature(message, signature, public_key)
print(f"Signature valid: {is_valid}")
```

### Secret Sharing

Split and reconstruct secrets using Shamir's Secret Sharing.

```python
from cryptography_suite.secret_sharing import create_shares, reconstruct_secret

secret = 1234567890
threshold = 3
num_shares = 5

# Create shares
shares = create_shares(secret, threshold, num_shares)

# Reconstruct the secret
selected_shares = shares[:threshold]
recovered_secret = reconstruct_secret(selected_shares)
print(f"Recovered secret: {recovered_secret}")
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

- **Secure Key Storage**: Store private keys securely, using encrypted files or hardware security modules (HSMs).
- **Password Management**: Use strong, unique passwords and consider integrating with secret management solutions.
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate cryptographic keys to minimize potential exposure.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive configurations to prevent hardcoding secrets.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date to benefit from the latest security patches.

## 🛠 Advanced Usage & Customization

- **Custom Encryption Modes**: Extend the suite by implementing additional encryption algorithms or modes tailored to your needs.
- **Adjustable Key Sizes**: Customize RSA or AES key sizes to meet specific security and performance requirements.
- **Integration with Other Libraries**: Seamlessly integrate with other Python libraries and frameworks for enhanced functionality.
- **Optimized Performance**: Utilize performance profiling tools to optimize cryptographic operations in high-load environments.
