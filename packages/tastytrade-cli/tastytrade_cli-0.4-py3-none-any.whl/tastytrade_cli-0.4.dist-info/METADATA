# tastytrade-cli

An easy-to-use command line interface for Tastytrade!

![Peek2024-07-0120-35-ezgif com-speed](https://github.com/tastyware/tastytrade-cli/assets/4185684/3d00731c-8f5e-40c5-973a-0f0357637083)

## Installation

```
$ pip install tastytrade-cli
```

> [!WARNING]  
> The CLI is still under active development. Please report any bugs, and contributions are always welcome!

## Usage

Available commands:
```
tt option              view chains, buy or sell equities and futures options
tt pf (portfolio)      view and close positions, check margin and analyze BP usage
tt trade               buy or sell stocks/ETFs, crypto, and futures
```
Unavailable commands pending development:
```
tt order               view, replace, and cancel orders
tt wl (watchlist)      view current prices and other data for symbols in your watchlists
```
For more options, run `tt --help` or `tt <subcommand> --help`.

## Configuration

Many aspects of the CLI's behavior can be customized using the `ttcli.cfg` file generated upon the first usage of the CLI. The file is located in your OS's home directory followed by the path `.config/ttcli/ttcli.cfg`. If you don't know where that is, you can just run `python -c "from ttcli.utils import config_path; print(config_path)"`.

The default configuration file contains lots of options along with explanations of what they do.

## Development/Contributing

This project includes a number of helpers in the `Makefile` to streamline common development tasks.
Make sure you already have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed!

Creating a virtualenv for development:
```
$ make install
```

It's usually a good idea to make sure you're passing tests locally before submitting a PR:
```
$ make lint
```
