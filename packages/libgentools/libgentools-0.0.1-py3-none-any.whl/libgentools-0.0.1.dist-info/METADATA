# libgentools

**A Python library for downloading content from [Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/).**

The library serves as a backend for [libgenx](https://github.com/gaaldvd/libgenx), a GUI/CLI application for using [LibGen](https://libgen.is/), but it is available for implementation in any other Python project as well.

Developers are welcome to fork this [repository](https://github.com/gaaldvd/libgentools).

## Installation

It is always recommended to use a Python environment manager, like [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/): `pipenv install libgentools`

But it is also possible to install the package system-wide: `pip install libgentools`

### Requirements

- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

## Usage

After installing from pip, import the library to your Python script:

```python
import libgentools
```

or

```python
from libgentools import SearchRequest, Results # ...
```

### Classes

#### SearchRequest

The class handles search requests and generates a list of results.

A new instance can be created with the `query` parameter. The query should be an author, title (or both) or an ISBN number:

```python
request = SearchRequest('principles of geology')
```

The `request.results` variable now holds the search results as a list of Standard Entry Dictionaries (SEDs).

*Standard Entry Dictionary*:

```python
entries = [{'id': 1234,
            'isbn': ["ISBN", "ISBN"],
            'auth': "Author",
            'title': "Title",
            'pub': "Publisher",
            'year': 1999,
            'pp': "Pages",
            'lang': "Language",
            'size': "Size",
            'ext': "Extension",
            'mirrors': ["url", "url"]}]
```

A new `Results` instance can be constructed from the `request.results` variable:

```python
results = Results(request.results)
```

#### Results

The class stores and manages search results.

A new instance can be created from the `results` variable of a `SearchRequest` instance:

```python
results = Results(request.results)
```

The results are now stored in the `results.entries` variable of the new instance as a list of SEDs.

##### Filtering

The `filter_entries` method filters the results using a Standard Filter Dictionary and the filtering mode as parameters.

*Standard Filter Dictionary*:

```python
filters = {'auth': "Author", 'ext': "Extension", 'year': "1999-2010"}
```

Every value must be a string! The following fields can be used in the filter:

- `auth`: author
- `title`: title
- `year`: as an interval (e.g. "1999-2010") or exact year (e.g. "2000")
- `lang`: use [standard language codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-code)
- `ext`: use any of the popular formats (e.g. "pdf", "epub", "mobi", etc.)

The `FILTERS` dictionary can be used to interpret command line arguments in applications.

The second parameter is the filtering mode: `"exact"` or `"partial"` (the default is `"partial"`). The method returns exact or partial matches based on this parameter.

The filtered results are returned by the method as a new `Results` instance:

```python
filtered_results = results.filter_entries(filters, "exact")
```

##### Downloading

Any entry from a list of results (SEDs) can be downloaded using the `download` method:

```python
downloaded = results.download(entry, dirname(abspath(sys.argv[0])))
```

The first parameter is the entry (an SED), the second is the path where the file should be downloaded (in this case the location of the script - `dirname()` and `abspath()` can be imported from `os.path`). The name of the downloaded file will be the LibGen ID of the entry. The value of the `downloaded` variable will be `true` if the download was successful or `false` otherwise.

### Exceptions

#### QueryError

The constructor of the `SearchRequest` class raises this error if the `query` is empty or its length is less than three characters.

#### FilterError

The `filter_entries` method of the `Results` class raises this error if there is an invalid key in the filtering dictionary (validated by `FILTERS`) or the year filter has a wrong format.

## Reporting errors

Any error can be reported through [e-mail](mailto:gaaldavid[at]tuta.io?subject=[GitHub]%20libgentools%20error) with the exact error message and/or console screenshot. Alternatively, an [issue](https://github.com/gaaldvd/libgentools/issues) can be opened.
