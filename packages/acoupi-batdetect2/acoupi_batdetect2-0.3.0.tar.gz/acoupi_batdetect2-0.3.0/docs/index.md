# acoupi_batdetect2

## What is acoupi_batdetect2?

*acoupi_batdetect2* is an open-source Python package that implement the [BatDetect2](https://github.com/macaodha/batdetect2) bioacoustic deep-learning model on edge devices like the RaspberryPi using the [_acoupi_](https://github.com/acoupi) framework. The BatDetect2 DL model has been developed by [Oisin M.A., et al.](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.14.520490) to detect and classify UK bats species. 

!!! Warning "What is the difference between _acoupi_ and _acoupi_batdetect2_?"

    __acoupi_batdetect2__ and [___acoupi___](https://acoupi.github.io/acoupi) are different. The __acoupi_batdetect2__ program is built on top of the ___acoupi___ python package. Think of ___acoupi___ like a bag of LEGO pieces that you can assemble into multiple shapes and forms. __acoupi_batdectect2__ would be the results of assembling some of these LEGO pieces into a "bat"!

??? Tip "Get familiar with _acoupi_"

    *acoupi_batdetect2* builds on and inherits features from _acoupi_. If you want to learn more the [_acoupi_](https://acoupi.github.io/acoupi) framework, we recommand starting with _acoupi's_ home documentation. 

## Requirements

*acoupi_batdetect2* is designed to run on single-board computers like the RaspberryÂ Pi.
It can be installed and tested on any Linux-based machines with Python version >=3.8,<3.12.

- A Linux-based single-board computer such as the Raspberry Pi 4B.
- A SD Card with the 64-bit Lite OS version installed.
- An ultrasonic USB Microphone, such as an [AudioMothÂ USBÂ Microphone](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth) or an Ultramic 192K/250K.


??? tip "Recommended Hardware"

    The software has been extensively developed and tested with the RPi 4B.
    We advise users to select the RPi 4B or a device featuring similar specifications.
