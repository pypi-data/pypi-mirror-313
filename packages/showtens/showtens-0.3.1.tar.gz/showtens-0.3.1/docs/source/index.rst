showtens Documentation
======================
**showtens** is a package for displaying tensors EASILY. In one line, you can 
view image tensors, whether they are batched or not, grayscale or not.
No need to spend several lines formatting, making into a grid, import matplotlib, etc.
In just one line, your tensor shows up. In just one line, it is saved.
