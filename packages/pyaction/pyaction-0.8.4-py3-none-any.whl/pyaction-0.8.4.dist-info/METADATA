PyAction helps you to develop [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) using Python. It's delivered as an installable package with the ability to run and test the action locally before any deployment.

```yml
- name: Using the python action
  uses: you/your-python-action@v2
  with:
      name: Jane
      age: 20
```

```python
from pyaction import PyAction


workflow = PyAction()

@workflow.action
def greetings_action(name: str, age: int) -> None:
    workflow.write(
        {
            "phrase": f"Hello {name}. You are {age}!"
        }
    )

# $ pyaction run
# [
#    {
#       "var": "phrase",
#       "value": "Hello Jane. You are 20!",
#       "type": "<class 'str'>",
#       "usage": "${{ steps.STEP_ID.outputs.phrase }}"
#    }
# ]
```

Check out the [official docs](https://pyaction.imsadra.me/docs) for more detailed information. There is also a [Quickstart](https://pyaction.imsadra.me/docs/overview/quickstart) demo tutorial that walks you through a simple hello-world action.

### Installation
Run the following command in a fresh CLI tab.

```sh
pip install -U "pyaction[cli]"
```

To make sure the installation process was successful, run the following command.

```sh
pyaction --version
```

The `pyaction` release is made to be super light which will make your workflow run very fast. The `pyaction[cli]` that you install on your local machine has some additional packages for local development.

### Usage
It's recommended to initialize a template, then going along the development process. Thus, run the `init` command.

```sh
pyaction init
```

Answer the prompts and your template will be generated. Check out the [docs](https://pyaction.imsadra.me/docs) for the further steps.
