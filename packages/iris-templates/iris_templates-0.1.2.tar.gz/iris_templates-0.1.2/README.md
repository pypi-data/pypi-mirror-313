## 🛠️ How to Use Iris

### Step 1: Install Iris

Install Iris via pip:

```bash
pip install iris-templates
```

### Step 2: Render Your First Template

Create a template file, e.g., `template.html`:

```html
@extends('base.html')

@section('title', 'Welcome to Iris')

@section('content')
    <h1>Hello, {{ user }}!</h1>
@endsection
```

Create a Python script to render the template:

```python
from altxria.iris.engine import TemplateEngine

engine = TemplateEngine(template_dir="./templates")
output = engine.render("template.html", {"user": "Alice"})
print(output)
```

### Step 3: Explore More Features

Iris provides advanced features for layout inheritance, template inclusion, and custom directives. For example:

#### Including Other Templates

```html
@include('header.html')

<p>This is the body content.</p>

@include('footer.html')
```

#### Dynamic Control Structures

```html
@if(user.is_admin)
    <p>Welcome, Admin {{ user.name }}!</p>
@else
    <p>Welcome, {{ user.name }}!</p>
@endif
```
