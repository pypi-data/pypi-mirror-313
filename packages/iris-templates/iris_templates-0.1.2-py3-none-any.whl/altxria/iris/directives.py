# ## Directives Class
#
# This module manages custom directives for template processing.
# Directives are user-defined handlers that can be registered and processed dynamically.
#
# ### Features:
# - Register custom directives with unique names.
# - Dynamically invoke handlers for registered directives.
# - Maintain a clean and extensible directive system.

class Directives:

    Manages custom directives for template processing.

    Attributes:
        directives (dict): A dictionary mapping directive names to their respective handlers.

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initializes the Directives class with an empty dictionary to store directive handlers.

        Args:
            name (str): The unique name of the directive.
            handler (callable): A function or callable object to handle the directive.

        Example:
            directives = Directives()
            directives.register("example", lambda args, context: f"Handled {args}")
