Description:

=========
OZI.build
=========

This is the `OZI-Project <https://github.com/OZI-Project>`_ maintained fork of the mesonpep517 0.2 tag.

This is a simple module that implements pep517 for the meson build system.

This means that you only need to provide a ``pyproject.toml`` in your project
source root to be able to publish your project built with meson on PyPI
and to create a wheel for the project.

For more information have a look at `the documentation <https://docs.oziproject.dev/en/stable/ozi_build.html>`_
