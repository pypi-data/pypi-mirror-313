    Generate a patch visualization for a 2D image with approximately square patches of a specified size in microns.
    Patches are evenly distributed across the image, using calculated strides and overlaps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array representing the input image to be divided into patches.
    pixel_resolution : float
        The pixel resolution of the image in microns per pixel.
    target_patch_size : float, optional
        The desired size of the patches in microns. Default is 40 microns.
    overlap_fraction : float, optional
        The fraction of the patch size to use as overlap between patches. Default is 0.5 (50%).

    Returns
    -------
    fig : matplotlib.figure.Figure
        A matplotlib figure containing the patch visualization.
    ax : matplotlib.axes.Axes
        A matplotlib axes object showing the patch layout on the image.
