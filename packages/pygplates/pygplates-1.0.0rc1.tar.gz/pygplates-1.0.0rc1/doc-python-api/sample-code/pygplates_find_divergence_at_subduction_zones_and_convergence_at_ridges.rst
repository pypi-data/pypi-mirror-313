Find divergence at subduction zones and convergence at ridges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example finds points on plate boundaries:

- where there's *convergence* along boundary sections labelled as *mid-ocean ridges*, and
- where there's *divergence* along boundary sections labelled as *subduction zones*

...over a series of geological times.
