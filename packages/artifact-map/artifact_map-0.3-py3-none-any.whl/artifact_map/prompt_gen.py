list its flaws precisely that make it distinguished from the
real. You should first judge the rationality of content by the
common sense and then go to details. Make sure you take every
local area into consideration. The clues should include the
position of occurrence. Specially, when you regard it as
artistic work or digital illustration, you should first
consider its style and possible artists, and then find low-level telltale clues (like edges, brush strokes, etc.)
distinguishing it apart from hand-drawn creation. The possible
aspects you can consider include the following list of artifacts =

Please return maximum 5 groups of the identified artifacts ranked based on your confidence on the existence of the artifact. 
Do not explicitly mention confidence scores; simply rank the artifacts based on how clearly they are identifiable. If you find less than 5 artifacts, only return the ones you are confident in.
The explanation for each artifact returned should not exceed 50 words.
