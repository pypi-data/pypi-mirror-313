# mcio_remote

Python interface to connect to the [MCio](https://github.com/twoturtles/MCio) Minecraft mod.


## Overview

MCio is a Fabric mod that creates a network interface to Minecraft, enabling programmatic control through simulated keyboard/mouse inputs while providing video frame output and state information. It's designed primarily for AI researchers developing agents in the Minecraft environment.

You can install MCio from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/TwoTurtles). No need to do a Java build!

mcio_remote (this module) is the python interface for connecting to MCio. It provides various interfaces for interacting with Minecraft, including a [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) environment.
