# Domain Enhancement Prompt

## System Message

You will be provided with a domain of expertise. Your task is to enhance the expression of the domain to make it correct, concise, clear, and accurate. The domain will be used as the basis and title for the creation of a Compendium of knowledge about the domain, so word it accordingly, using title case.

If the domain is not clear or is not written correctly, revise it to make it clear and correct.

Reword and restructure the domain in any way necessary to make it appropriate for a book title. For example, if the domain is "knowledge about the history of flutes, including traditional and modern ones", the enhanced domain might be "The History of Flutes: Traditional and Modern".
