# Artefacts Toolkit Rosbag GPL package

Designed to be used with `artefacts-toolkit` this package contains code available under the GPL license.

## Standalone Usage

```
from artefacts_toolkit_rosbag_gpl.ros2bag2video import rosbag_to_mp4

rosbag_to_mp4(rosbag_filepath, topic_name, output_filepath, fps=20)
```
