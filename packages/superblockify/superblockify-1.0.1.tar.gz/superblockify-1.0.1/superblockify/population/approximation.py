    Calculates the population and area of the edges. First tessellates the edges

    attributes `population` and `area` of the graph in-place.
    Furthermore, `cell_id` is added to the edge attributes, for easier summary of
    statistics later. The graph attribute `edge_population` is set to True.

    Parameters
    ----------
