I've worked with a lot of talented people over the years, and there are a few I'd love to collaborate with again. The best part? They're eager to join forces too, so there's a fresh win-win situation just waiting to be tapped.\n  \n\nSo, whether you need a seasoned developer or a full-fledged team, I'm just an email away. Click the button below or drop me a line at [jochen-resume@wersdoerfer.de](mailto:jochen-resume@wersdoerfer.de), and let's turn your ideas into reality—and maybe have some fun along the way!\n\n\nCheers,\nJochen\n  \n  "
