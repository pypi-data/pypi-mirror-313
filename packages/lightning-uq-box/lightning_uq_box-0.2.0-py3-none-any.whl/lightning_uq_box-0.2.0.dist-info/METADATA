           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# lightning-uq-box

The lightning-uq-box is a PyTorch library that provides various Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques for modern neural network architectures.

We hope to provide the starting point for a collaborative open source effort to make it easier for practitioners to include UQ in their workflows and
remove possible barriers of entry. Additionally, we hope this can be a pathway to more easily compare methods across UQ frameworks and potentially enhance the development of new UQ methods for neural networks.

*The project is currently under active development, but we nevertheless hope for early feedback, feature requests, or contributions. Please check the [Contribution Guide](https://lightning-uq-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute.html) for further information.*

The goal of this library is threefold:

1. Provide implementations for a variety of Uncertainty Quantification methods for Modern Deep Neural Networks that work with a range of neural network architectures and have different theoretical underpinnings
2. Make it easy to compare UQ methods on a given dataset
3. Focus on reproducibility of experiments with minimum boiler plate code and standardized evaluation protocols

To this end, each UQ-Method is essentially just a [Lightning Module](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/lightning_module.html) which can be used with a [Lightning Data Module](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/data/datamodule.html) and a [Trainer](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/trainer.html) to execute training, evaluation and inference for your desired task. The library also utilizes the [Lightning Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.cli.LightningCLI.html) for better reproducibility of experiments and setting up experiments at scale.

# Theory Guide

For a comprehensive document that provides more mathematical details for each method and generally forms the basis of our implementations, please see the [Theory Guide](./docs/api/Lightning_UQ_Box_Theory_Guide.pdf). As a living document, we plan to update it as the library encompasses more methods. If you have any questions, or find typos or errors, feel free to open an issue.

# Installation

The recommended way to install the latest released version is via pip,

```console
pip install lightning-uq-box
```

For the latest development version you can run,

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/lightning-uq-box/lightning-uq-box.git
```

The package is also available for installation via conda or spack. You can find instructions in the [documention](https://lightning-uq-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

# UQ-Methods

In the tables that follow below, you can see what UQ-Method/Task combination is currently supported by the Lightning-UQ-Box via these indicators:

- ✅ supported
- ❌ not designed for this task
- ⏳ in progress

The implemented methods are of course not exhaustive, as the number of new methods keeps increasing. For an overview of methods that we are tracking or are planning to support, take a look at [this issue](https://github.com/lightning-uq-box/lightning-uq-box/issues/43).

## Classification of UQ-Methods

The following sections aims to give an overview of different UQ-Methods by grouping them according to some commonalities. We agree that there could be other groupings as well and welcome suggestions to improve this overview. We also follow this grouping for the API documentation in the hopes to make navigation easier.

# Tutorials

We try to provide many different tutorials so that users can get a better understanding of implemented methods and get a feel for how they apply to different problems.
Head over to the [tutorials](https://lightning-uq-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_overview.html) page to get started. These tutorials can also be launched in google colab if you navigate to the rocket icon at the top of a tutorial page.

# Documentation
We aim to provide an extensive documentation on all included UQ-methods that provide some theoretical background, as well as tutorials that illustrate these methods on toy datasets.
