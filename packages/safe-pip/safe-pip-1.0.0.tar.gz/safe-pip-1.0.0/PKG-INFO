# safe-pip

`safe-pip` is a wrapper around the standard `pip` command that checks the health score of a package from [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor/python/) before installation. It informs you about the package's health and asks for confirmation before proceeding.

## Installation

Install `safe-pip` using pip:

```bash
pip install safe-pip
```

## Usage
Use safe-pip just like you would use pip:

```bash
safe-pip install package_name
```

## Replacing `pip` with `safe-pip`
If you want to replace the pip command with safe-pip, you can create an alias or a symbolic link.

Add the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc):

```bash
alias pip='safe-pip'
```

Or, use this one-liner.
### Zsh
```bash
echo "alias pip='safe-pip'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Bash
```bash
echo "alias pip='safe-pip'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Fish
```bash
alias -s pip "safe-pip"
```
