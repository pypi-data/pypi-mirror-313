This is a base module and does nothing on its own. It provides an
abstract model that can be instantiated to include additional
information on PDF reports footer.

Configuration
=============

In order to include additional information in the PDF footer of a given
model, it is necessary to create a new module that depends on this one
and do the following:

1. Inherit the abstract class "footer.extra.info.mixin" from the model
   which could add information to the PDF footer.
2. Override the \_compute_footer_extra_info method in
   "footer.extra.info.mixin" to set a value in field footer_extra_info,
   which is the field that contains the information that is added to the
   PDF footer.
