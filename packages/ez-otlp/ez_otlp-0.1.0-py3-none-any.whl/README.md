# ez-otlp

> ez-otlp is a simple tool that enables convenient use of modern monitoring systems with minimal configuration. It helps developers streamline telemetry data collection and transmission, making it ideal for services in modern cloud-native applications and microservices architectures. It efficiently collects logs, metrics, and traces via OpenTelemetry and seamlessly integrates with existing monitoring tools and platforms like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, and more.

🚀 Quickly implement application performance monitoring, log management, distributed tracing, metrics and dashboards, and alerts.
🛠️ 99% of parameter configurations are resolved through environment variables, making it plug-and-play and ready to seamlessly integrate with OpenTelemetry without the need for complex parameters.
❤️ The demo uses SigNoz for an intuitive interface that showcases the power of modern monitoring systems.
