#### Hi, looking at this there isn't a way currently to filter by event type. Can you add one please?  

I'll add event type filtering functionality to the CLI. We'll need to:

1. Add a new CLI option for event type filtering
2. Modify the event processing logic to filter events
3. Update the README to document the new feature
4. Add a test for the new functionality

Here are the changes:

esdbcat/cli.py
<source>python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
@click.option('-v', '--verbose', is_flag=True, help='Enable verbose output')
@click.argument('stream_name')
def main(url: Optional[str], host: str, follow: bool, metadata: bool,  # noqa: PLR0913, PLR0912
         offset: str, count: Optional[int], quiet: bool, verbose: bool,
         stream_name: str) -> None:

@click.option('-v', '--verbose', is_flag=True, help='Enable verbose output')
@click.option('-t', '--type', 'event_type', help='Filter events by type')
@click.argument('stream_name')

         offset: str, count: Optional[int], quiet: bool, verbose: bool,
         event_type: Optional[str], stream_name: str) -> None:

                    output = process_event(event, metadata, verbose)
                    if output:
                        click.echo(json.dumps(output))

                    processed += 1

                    if event_type and event.type != event_type:
                        continue

                    output = process_event(event, metadata, verbose)
                    if output:
                        click.echo(json.dumps(output))

                    processed += 1

def test_event_type_filtering(test_context: StreamContext) -> None:
    """Test filtering events by type."""
    # Write events with different types
    client = test_context.client
    stream = test_context.stream_name
    
    # Event with type "TypeA"
    data = json.dumps({"message": "Event A"}).encode()
    client.append_to_stream(
        stream,
        current_version=StreamState.ANY,
        events=[NewEvent(type="TypeA", data=data)]
    )
    
    # Event with type "TypeB"
    data = json.dumps({"message": "Event B"}).encode()
    client.append_to_stream(
        stream,
        current_version=StreamState.ANY,
        events=[NewEvent(type="TypeB", data=data)]
    )

    # Test filtering for TypeA
    result = run_esdbcat(test_context.eventstore_host, "-t", "TypeA", "-q", test_context.stream_name)
    events = [json.loads(line) for line in result.stdout.strip().split("\n")]
    assert len(events) == 1
    assert events[0]["metadata"]["type"] == "TypeA"
    assert events[0]["data"]["message"] == "Event A"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</source>

Let me explain the changes:

1. Added a new `--type` option to filter events by their type
2. Modified the event processing loop to skip events that don't match the specified type
3. Updated the README with an example of the new filtering option
4. Added a new test case to verify the filtering functionality

You can try the new functionality with:

```bash
esdbcat -t UserCreated my-stream
```

This will only show events of type "UserCreated" from the stream.

#### Good job! Could you run (propose) the testsuite?  

I'll help you run the test suite. Based on the project configuration in pyproject.toml, you can run the tests using pytest. First, make sure you have the test dependencies installed, then run the tests:

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest tests/
```

This will run all the tests, including the new test_event_type_filtering test we added to verify the event type filtering functionality.

#### Alright, great! Could you release 0.2.0 with this please?  

I'll help you release version 0.2.0. We need to update the version number in two files:

esdbcat/__init__.py
<source>python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
__version__ = "0.1.3"
=======
__version__ = "0.2.0"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</source>

pyproject.toml
<source>python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
version = "0.1.3"
=======
version = "0.2.0"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</source>

After making these changes, you can build and publish the release with:

```bash
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```

Note: Make sure you have your PyPI credentials configured before running twine upload. You might want to test the upload to TestPyPI first with:

```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

Don't forget to create a git tag for the release:

```bash
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release version 0.2.0"
git push origin v0.2.0
```
