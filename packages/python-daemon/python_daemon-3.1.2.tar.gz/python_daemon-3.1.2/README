Library to implement a well-behaved Unix daemon process
#######################################################

This library implements the well-behaved daemon specification of
:pep:`3143`, “Standard daemon process library”.

A well-behaved Unix daemon process is tricky to get right, but the
required steps are much the same for every daemon program. A
`DaemonContext` instance holds the behaviour and configured process
environment for the program; use the instance as a context manager to
enter a daemon state.

Simple example of usage::

    import daemon

    from spam import do_main_program

    with daemon.DaemonContext():
        do_main_program()

Customisation of the steps to become a daemon is available by setting
options on the `DaemonContext` instance; see the documentation for
that class for each option.
