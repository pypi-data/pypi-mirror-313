Version 3.1.2
=============

:Released: 2024-12-03
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* In wheel, distribute only the Python packages that should be installed.

  Closes: Pagure #98.

Changed:

* Migrate project code base from “flat layout” to “src layout”.

  This commits us to a build step for running the test suite, ensuring the
  built package works.

  See <URL:
  https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/
  > for more discussion.


Version 3.1.1
=============

:Released: 2024-12-02
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Remove unused run-time dependency on Setuptools.

  Closes: Pagure #97. Thanks to Michał Górny for the report.

* Restore inclusion of documentation source in source distribution.

Removed:

* Cease signing releases, as GnuPG signatures no longer supported by PyPI.

  See <URL: https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-05-23-removing-pgp/ > for the
  announcement by PyPI maintainers.


Version 3.1.0
=============

:Released: 2024-10-25
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Correct a non-deterministic test case that would sometimes fail.

  Because of test data that was incorrectly choosing a random value for the
  property being tested, the test case would succeed or fail unreliably.

  Closes: Pagure #96. Thanks to Joseph Tate for the report and implementation.

* Increase minimum Python version required, to “>= 3.7”.

  The interface `setuptools.command.build`, introduced in Setuptools version
  “62.4.0”, requires Python version >= 3.7.

  Closes: Pagure #79. Thanks to Edison Wong for the report and implementation.

* Get metadata from Change Log at build time only.

  This removes the need for Setuptools “entry points” feature at build time.

  Closes: Pagure #94. Thanks to Branch Vincent for assistance.
  Closes: Pagure #86.
  Closes: Pagure #85. Thanks to Attila Lendvai for the report.
  Closes: Pagure #82.

* Migrate optional dependencies to PEP 621 declarations.

  This uses the named groups for developing and building the package, versus
  the core requirements for installing and running the distribution.

  Closes: Pagure #52. Thanks to Stoyan Nikolov, Neil Hanlon.
  Closes: Pagure #93. Thanks to Michał Górny for the report.

Changed:

* Migrate all Setuptools-specific options to PEP 621 declarations.

  The ‘pyproject.toml’ configuration file now contains explicit declaration of
  all project configuration, ending the need to run ‘setup.py’ as a program.

  Closes: Pagure #71.

Removed:

* Remove dynamically-constructed non-standard metadata attributes.

  All these attributes are now met by the standard `“Core Metadata”
  <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/>`_
  specification.


Version 3.0.2
=============

:Released: 2024-07-27
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Migrate to use the explicitly-maintained ‘packaging’ library.

  The package bundled in ‘setuptools.extern.packaging’ is to help make that
  package self-contained, but is not a supported API.

  Closes: Pagure #73. Thanks to Michał Górny for the report.

Changed:

* Clarify copyright and grants of license.

  The new file `COPYING` now comprehensively describes grants of license to all
  parts of this distribution.

* Migrate to PEP 517 simple build system for Python distribution.

  This makes it easier to de-couple from Setuptools-specific declarations; we
  stop using the deprecated command-line invocations of ‘setup.py’ as a
  program.

  Closes: Pagure #87. Thanks to Attila Lendvai for the report.


Version 3.0.1
=============

:Released: 2023-03-08
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Declare dependency on Setuptools >= 62.4.0.

  This is necessary for establishing the version information via Setuptools. We
  use ‘setuptools.command.build’, `introduced in Setuptools version 62.4.0
  <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/stable/history.html#v62-4-0>`_.

  Closes: Pagure #74. Thanks to Edison Wong for the report.

Added:

* PyPA recommended Project URLs for the distribution.


Version 3.0.0
=============

:Released: 2023-03-04
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Refactor calculation of file descriptor ranges to close.

  When the range of candidate file descriptors is very large, the code that
  computes file descriptors to close when the daemon starts attempted to
  allocate a large amount of memory and took a long time to compute.

  Thanks to Alex Pyrgiotis for the timing test case.

  This change avoids that resource-intensive computation, and significantly
  improves the performance when importing the module and when starting the
  daemon.

  Thanks to Igor Kholopov for the implementation.

  Closes: Pagure #72. Thanks to Anton Anton for the report.

Added:

* Document a `ServiceRunner` class as an example of using `DaemonContext`.

Changed:

* Raise a TypeError if any `exclude` values are not valid file descriptors.

  Formerly, an invalid value might be silently ignored.

  Thanks to Igor Kholopov for the suggestion.

* Migrate package version handling to use Setuptools API.

  The Distutils library is deprecated for direct use; see
  `<https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#distutils-deprecated>`_.

  Closes: Pagure #70.

Removed:

* Remove redundant ‘wheel’ from the requirements specification.

  As described by the Python Packaging Authority:

      This [‘wheel’] dependency is exposed automatically by setuptools and the
      users do not need to declare it explicitly — it will be installed by PEP
      517 front-ends automatically, when building wheels.

  Thanks to Michał Górny for the implementation.

* Remove Setuptools ‘test’ command support.

  The ‘test’ command is formally deprecated, in favour of dedicated test
  runners. `<https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/stable/history.html#v41-5-0>`_

* Remove Setuptools ‘register’ and ‘upload’ command support.

  The commands to publish a distribution to PyPI are removed, in favour of the
  Twine tool. `<https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/stable/history.html#v42-0-0>`_

* Remove the obsolete `runner` module.

  This module was deprecated starting in `python-daemon` version 2.1.2, and is
  now removed as unmaintained.


Version 2.3.2
=============

:Released: 2022-10-23
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Declare Twine as a development dependency (not a build dependency).

  Closes: Pagure #55. Thanks to Jason Andryuk for the report.
  Thanks to James Hilliard for the implementation.

* Specify to build a wheel distribution for only Python 3 or later.

* Specify the built package requires Python 3 or later.

  Closes: Pagure #66. Thanks to Nick M. for the report and implementation.

Removed:

* The earlier version 2.3.1 is now “yanked” from PyPI (unlisted and not an
  installation candidate), because that version incorrectly permitted
  installation on Python 2. Thanks to Nick M. for the report.


Version 2.3.1
=============

:Released: 2022-07-19
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Avoid operations on a closed stream file when detecting a socket.

  Closes: Pagure #64. Thanks to Mark Richman for the report.

* Correct use of names to allow `from daemon import *`.

  Closes: Pagure #65. Thanks to July Tikhonov for the report.

Changed:

* Speed daemon start time by computing candidate file descriptors once.

  Closes: Pagure #40. Thanks to Alex Pyrgiotis for the report.

* Remove incorrect double-patch of objects in test cases.

  Closes: Pagure #62. Thanks to Miro Hrončok for the report.

* Deprecate helper function `is_socket`.

  The function incorrectly causes `ValueError` when the file object is already
  closed. Migrate to the new `is_socket_file` helper function instead.

Removed:

* Drop backward-compatible helpers that provided Python 2 support.

  * declaration of source encoding ‘utf-8’
  * absolute_import
  * unicode_literals
  * module-level metaclass `type`
  * unification of str with unicode type
  * renamed standard library exceptions and modules
  * raise exception from context exception

  All these are default behaviour in Python 3 and need no special
  handling.


Version 2.3.0
=============

:Released: 2021-02-21
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Removed:

* Remove support for Python versions older than Python 3.

  Python 2 has been unsupported by the Python project since 2020.

* Remove dependency on back-ported `unittest2` and `mock`.
  Depend instead on standard library `unittest` and `unittest.mock`.

  Thanks to Michał Górny for the merge requests.


Version 2.2.4
=============

:Released: 2019-10-27
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Run the Setuptools `egg-info` command as part of the `build`
  command.

  Closes: Pagure #31. Thanks to Stanislav Levin for the bug report and
  diagnosis.

* Create the socket and catch “non-socket” errors.

  Closes: Pagure #34. Thanks to Miro Hrončok for the bug report and
  patch.

* Only deal with a range of file descriptors if the range is not empty.

  Closes: Pagure #39. Thanks to Alex Pyrgiotis for the test scenario.

* Declare Twine as a build dependency.

* Reformat the change log entries with keepachangelog.com sub-sections.

Changed:

* Upgrade Tox dependency to version “3.7.0”.

  Thanks to Miro Hrončok for the contribution.

* Significant speed-up to discovery of file descriptors to close.

  By using a native `tuple` for the heavily-used file descriptor range
  representation, this gives approximately 5× faster calls to
  `close_all_open_files` in the typical case. This partially addresses
  Pagure #40.

  Thanks to Alex Pyrgiotis for testing various alternative proposals.

* Refactor the build system to use Makefile modules for each topic.


Version 2.2.3
=============

:Released: 2019-01-21
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Use custom fake file type for testing `fileno` behaviour.

  This works around an incompatibility in Python 2.7 `file` type that
  caused test cases to fail.

Deprecated:

* Promote the warning for `runner` module to a `DeprecationWarning`.
  This has been an unofficial example module from the beginning, and
  it will be removed in a future version.


Version 2.2.2
=============

:Released: 2019-01-19
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Add a :PEP:`518` conformant build system specification (the
  ``pyproject.toml`` file).


Version 2.2.0
=============

:Released: 2018-08-15
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Correct the description of the return value for
  `daemon.is_detach_process_context_required`.

  Closes: Pagure #6.

* Set a sensible default for `Distribution.script_name`.

  This works around a bug in Setuptools which calls commands before
  the `Distribution` is initialised.

  Closes: Pagure #2.

Changed:

* The test suite now relies on the test discovery feature in
  ‘unittest’. This feature is in Python version 2.7 and later.

* Improve performance of `daemon.close_all_open_files`.

  Thanks to Darek Działak for the implementation.

  Closes: Pagure #10.

:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Added:

* Add a README document for the code base.

Changed:

* Migrate code project hosting to Pagure.
  Record the change of homepage URL in PyPI metadata.

Deprecated:

* Raise a warning that the ‘runner’ module is pending deprecation.
  This has been an unofficial example module from the beginning, and
  it will be removed in a future version.

Bugs Fixed:

* Ensure custom types are part of the Python type hierarchy.
* Avoid a circular dependency for the version string at install time.
  Thanks to Maarten van Gompel for the reproducible test case.


Version 2.1.1
=============

:Released: 2016-01-30
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:

* Default ‘initgroups’ option to False. Using ‘os.initgroups’ requires
  permission to set process GID, so this now needs to be explicitly
  requested.


Version 2.1.0
=============

:Released: 2015-11-26
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Added:

* Add a DaemonContext option, ‘initgroups’, which specifies whether to
  set the daemon process's supplementary groups.

  installation can be found.


Version 1.5.4
=============

:Released: 2010-02-27
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bugs Fixed:
