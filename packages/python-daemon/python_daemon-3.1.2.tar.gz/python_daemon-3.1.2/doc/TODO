Standard library inclusion
==========================


====
DONE
====

* Convert to Python 2 and Python 3 compatible code base.

* Work correctly with current ‘lockfile’ library (0.10 or later).

* Write full unit tests for every new or changed behaviour at time of
  commit.

* Detect whether started by another process that handles
  daemonisation, such as ‘inetd’, and behave appropriately.

* Detach to new process and session group.

* Allow specification of working directory (default: '/').

* Allow specification of umask (default: 0o000).

* Drop ‘suid’ and ‘sgid’ privileges if set.

* Close all open file handles.

* Re-open stdin, stdout, stderr to user-specified files.

* Default re-open stdin, stdout, stderr to ‘/dev/null’.

* Allow specification of a non-root user and group to drop to, if
  started as ‘root’ (default: no change of user or group).

* Implement context manager protocol for daemon context.

* Allow specification of PID file with its own context manager
  (default: no PID file).

* Full docstrings for functions, classes, and modules.

* PEP 3143 for adding this library to the Python standard library.
