**BigQuery-advanced-utils** is a lightweight utility library that extends the official Google BigQuery Python client.  
It simplifies tasks like **query management**, *data processing*, and *automation*.  

Aimed at **developers** and **data scientists**, the project is open to *contributions* to improve and enhance its functionality.

## Why This Library?

I created **bigquery-advanced-utils** because I often found myself facing complex or uncommon tasks when working with BigQuery, and there was little or no support available online. Rather than spending time reinventing the wheel, I decided to create this library to help others avoid the same challenges. I hope that everyone can contribute in the same spirit, so feel free to get involved and make this library even better!

## Planned features
- A new query builder.
- Custom data transformation and processing functions.
- Exclusive features with datatransfer.
- Utility functions to manipulate strings and query.

## Installation
Install `bigquery-advanced-utils` via pip:
```bash
pip install bigquery-advanced-utils
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Google Cloud BigQuery client library
