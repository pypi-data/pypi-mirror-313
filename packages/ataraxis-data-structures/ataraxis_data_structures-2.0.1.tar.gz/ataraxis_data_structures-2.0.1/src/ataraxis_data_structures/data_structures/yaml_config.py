"""This module contains the YamlConfig class, which is an extension of the standard Python dataclass that comes with
methods to save and load itself to / from a .yml (YAML) file.

Primarily, this class is designed to be used for storing configuration data used by other runtimes in non-volatile
memory in a human-readable format. However, it can also be adapted for intermediate-term data storage, if needed.

    """A Python dataclass bundled with methods to save and load itself from a .yml (YAML) file.

    This class extends the base functionality of Python dataclasses by bundling them with the ability to serialize the
    data into non-volatile memory as .yml files. Primarily, this is used to store configuration information for
    various runtimes, but this can also be adapted as a method of storing data.

    Notes:
        The class is intentionally kept as minimal as possible and does not include built-in data verification.
        You need to implement your own data verification methods if you need that functionality. NestedDictionary
        class from this library may be of help, as it was explicitly designed to simplify working with complex
        dictionary structures, such as those obtained by casting a deeply nested dataclass as a dictionary.
