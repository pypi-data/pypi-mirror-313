## **What is KitchenAI?**  
KitchenAI bridges the gap between **AI developers**, **application developers**, and **Infrastructure developers** making it easy to:  

- For **AI Developers**: Focus on your techniques like RAG or embeddings‚ÄîKitchenAI handles scalable, production-ready features through ecosystem building blocks.  
- For **App Developers**: Seamlessly integrate AI with open-source APIs and robust backends built on Django.

- For **Infrastructure Developers**: Integrate seamlessly with AI tooling, customize Django backends, and leverage built-in support for observability platforms like Sentry and OpenTelemetry, ensuring scalable and production-ready deployments with tools like Docker and Kubernetes.  

**Say goodbye to boilerplate!**
