## regenie 

**regenie** is a C++ program for whole genome regression modelling of large
[genome-wide association studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study).

It is developed and supported by a team of scientists at the Regeneron Genetics Center.

The method has the following properties

- It works on quantitative and binary traits, including binary
traits with unbalanced case-control ratios
- It can handle population structure and relatedness
- It can process multiple phenotypes at once efficiently
- For binary traits, it supports Firth logistic regression and an SPA test
- It can perform gene/region-based tests (Burden, SKAT/SKATO, ACATV/ACATO)
- It can perform interaction tests (GxE, GxG) as well as conditional analyses
- It is fast and memory efficient ðŸ”¥
- It supports the [BGEN](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format/), [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats#bed) bed/bim/fam and [PLINK2](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/formats#pgen) pgen/pvar/psam genetic data formats
- It is ideally suited for implementation in
  [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) (see [GLOW](https://projectglow.io/))
- It can be installed with [Conda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/regenie)
