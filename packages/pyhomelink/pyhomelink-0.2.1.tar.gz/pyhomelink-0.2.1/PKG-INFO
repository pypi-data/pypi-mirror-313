# python_homelink
Python library for accessing AICO HomeLINK services.

**Note:-** This library requires Python 3.11.

## Introduction

This library enables access to the AICO HomeLINK API for retrieving the following items:
* Property
* Devices
* Alerts
* Insights
* Lookups
* Readings

### [Buy Me A ~~Coffee~~ Beer üçª](https://buymeacoffee.com/rogtp)
I work on this library because I like things to work well for myself and others, and for it to deliver as much as is achievable with the API. Please don't feel you are obligated to donate, but of course it is appreciated.
