.. marker-introduction

``torch-pme`` enables efficient, auto-differentiable computation of long-range
interactions in PyTorch. Auto-differentiation is supported for particle *positions*,
*charges*, and *cell* parameters, allowing not only the automatic computation of forces
but also enabling general applications in machine learning tasks. The library offers
classes for Particle-Particle Particle-Mesh Ewald (P3M), Particle Mesh Ewald (``PME``),
standard ``Ewald``, and non-periodic methods, with the flexibility to calculate
potentials beyond :math:`1/r` electrostatics, including arbitrary order :math:`1/r^p`
potentials.

Optimized for both CPU and GPU devices, ``torch-pme`` is fully `TorchScriptable`_,
allowing it to be converted into a format that runs independently of Python, such as in
C++, making it ideal for high-performance production environments.

Installation
------------

You can install *torch-pme* using pip with

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/lab-cosmo/torch-pme
    cd torch-pme
    pip install .

You can then ``import torchpme`` and use it in your projects!

We also provide bindings to `metatensor <https://docs.metatensor.org/latest/>`_ which
can optionally be installed together and used as ``torchpme.metatensor`` via

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .[metatensor]
