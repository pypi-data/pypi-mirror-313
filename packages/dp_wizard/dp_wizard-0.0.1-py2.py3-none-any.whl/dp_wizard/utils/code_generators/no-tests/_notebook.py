# This is a demonstration of how OpenDP can be used to create
# a differentially private release. To learn more about what's

# Based on the input you provided, for each column we'll create a set of cut points,
# and a Polars expression that describes how we want to summarize that column.

# Next, we'll define our Context. This is where we set the privacy budget,
# and set the weight for each query under that overall budget.
# If we try to run more one more query than we have weights, it will error.
# Once the privacy budget is consumed, you shouldn't run more queries.

# A note on `utf8-lossy`: CSVs can use different "character encodings" to
# represent characters outside the plain ascii character set, but out of the box
# the Polars library only supports UTF8. Specifying `utf8-lossy` preserves as
# much information as possible, and any unrecognized characters will be replaced
# by "ï¿½". If this is not sufficient, you will need to preprocess your data to
# reencode it as UTF8.
#
# Finally, we run the queries and plot the results.
