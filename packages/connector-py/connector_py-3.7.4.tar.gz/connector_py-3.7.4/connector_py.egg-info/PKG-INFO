           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Installation

```console
pip install connector-py
```

## Usage

The package can be used in three ways:

1. A CLI to scaffold a custom connector with its own CLI to call commands
2. A library to create a custom connector

To get started, run `connector --help`

An example of running a command that accepts arguments
in an integration connector called `mock-connector`:

```shell
mock-connector info
mock-connector validate_credentials --json '{"request":{},"auth":{}}'
```

### Connector implementation

Connectors can implement whichever Lumos capabilities make sense for the underlying app.

To see what a minimal implementation looks like, you can run

```sh
connector scaffold foo-bar projects/connectors/python/foo-bar
```

`projects/connectors/python/foo-bar/foo_bar/integration.py` will look something like this:

```python
integration = Integration(
    app_id="github",
    version=__version__,
    auth=BasicCredential,
    settings_model=FooBarSettings,
    exception_handlers=[
        (httpx.HTTPStatusError, HTTPHandler, None),
    ],
    description_data=DescriptionData(
        logo_url="https://logo.clearbit.com/foobar.com",
        user_friendly_name="Foo Bar",
        description="Foobar is a cloud-based platform that lets you manage foos and bars",
        categories=[AppCategory.DEVELOPERS, AppCategory.COLLABORATION],
    ),
    resource_types=resource_types,
    entitlement_types=entitlement_types,
)
```

Once an integration is created, you can register handlers for Lumos capabilities.

```py
@integration.register_capability(CapabilityName.LIST_ACCOUNTS)
async def list_accounts(request: ListAccountsRequest) -> ListAccountsResponse:
    # do whatever is needed to get accounts
    return ListAccountsResponse(
        response=[],
        raw_data=raw_data if request.include_raw_data else None,
        ...
    )
```

### Error Handling

Error handling is facilitated through an exception handler decorator.

An exception handler can be attached to the connector library as follows:

```python
from httpx import HTTPStatusError
from connector.oai.errors import HTTPHandler

integration = Integration(
    ...,
    exception_handlers=[
        (HTTPStatusError, HTTPHandler, None),
    ],
    handle_errors=True,
)
```

The decorator accepts a list of tuples of three. First tuple argument is the exception you would like to be catching, second is the handler (default or implemented on your own) and third is a specific error code that you would like to associate with this handler.

By default it is recommended to make use of the default HTTPHandler which will handle `raise_for_status()` for you and properly error code it. For more complex errors it is recommended to subclass the ExceptionHandler (in `connector/oai/errors.py`) and craft your own handler.

#### Raising an exception

Among this, there is a custom exception class available as well as a default list of error codes:

```python
from connector.oai.errors import ConnectorError
from connector.generated import ErrorCode

def some_method(self, args):
    raise ConnectorError(
        message="Received wrong data, x: y",
        app_error_code="foobar.some_unique_string",
        error_code=ErrorCode.BAD_REQUEST,
    )
```

It is preferred to raise any manually raisable exception with this class. A connector can implement its own error codes list, which should be properly documented.

### Response

Error codes are by default prefixed with the app_id of the connector that has raised the exception. In your implementation you don't need to worry about this and can only focus on the second and optionally third level of the error code.

An example response when handled this way:

```json
// BAD_REQUEST error from github connector
{"error":{"message":"Some message","status_code":400,"error_code":"github.bad_request","raised_by":"HTTPStatusError","raised_in":"github.sync_.lumos:validate_credentials"}, "response": null, "raw_data": null}
```

### OAuth Module

The OAuth module is responsible for handling the OAuth2.0 flow for a connector.
It is configured with `oauth_settings` in the `Integration` class.
Not configuring this object will disable the OAuth module completely.

```python
from connector.oai.modules.oauth_module_types import (
    OAuthSettings,
    OAuthCapabilities,
    OAuthRequest,
    RequestDataType,
)

integration = Integration(
    ...,
    oauth_settings=OAuthSettings(
        # Authorization & Token URLs for the particular connector
        authorization_url="https://app.connector.com/oauth/authorize",
        token_url="https://api.connector.com/oauth/v1/token",

        # Scopes per capability (space delimited string)
        scopes={
            CapabilityName.VALIDATE_CREDENTIALS: "test:scope another:scope",
            ... # further capabilities as implemented in the connector
        },

        # You can modify the request type if the default is not appropriate
        # common options for method are "POST" and "GET"
        # available options for data are "FORMDATA", "QUERY", and "JSON" (form-data / url query params / json body)
        # *default is POST and FORMDATA*
        request_type=OAuthRequest(data=RequestDataType.FORMDATA),

        # You can modify the authentication method if the default is not appropriate
        # available options for auth_method are "CLIENT_SECRET_POST" and "CLIENT_SECRET_BASIC"
        # *default is CLIENT_SECRET_POST*
        client_auth=ClientAuthenticationMethod.CLIENT_SECRET_POST,

        # You can turn off specific or all capabilities for the OAuth module
        # This means that these will either be skipped or you have to implement them manually
        capabilities=OAuthCapabilities(
            refresh_access_token=False,
        ),

        # You can specify the type of OAuth flow to use
        # Available options are "CODE_FLOW" and "CLIENT_CREDENTIALS"
        # *default is CODE_FLOW*
        flow_type=OAuthFlowType.CODE_FLOW,
    ),
)
```

It might happen that your integration requires a dynamic authorization/token URL.
For example when the service provider has specific URLs and uses the customers custom subdomain. (eg. `https://{subdomain}.service.com/oauth/authorize`)
In that case you can pass a callable that takes the request args (`AuthRequest`, without the auth parameter) as an argument (only available during request).

```python
# method definitions
def get_authorization_url(args: AuthRequest) -> str:
    settings = get_settings(args, ConnectorSettings)
    return f"https://{settings.subdomain}.service.com/oauth/authorize"

def get_token_url(args: AuthRequest) -> str:
    settings = get_settings(args, ConnectorSettings)
    return f"https://{settings.subdomain}.service.com/oauth/token"

# oauth settings
integration = Integration(
    ...,
    oauth_settings=OAuthSettings(
        authorization_url=get_authorization_url,
        token_url=get_token_url,
    ),
)
```

#### OAuth Flow Types

The OAuth module supports two flow types:
- `CODE_FLOW`: The authorization code flow (default)
- `CLIENT_CREDENTIALS`: The client credentials flow (sometimes called "2-legged OAuth" or "Machine-to-Machine OAuth")

The flow type can be specified in the `OAuthSettings` object.

Using the authorization code flow you have three available capabalities:
- `GET_AUTHORIZATION_URL`: To get the authorization URL
- `HANDLE_AUTHORIZATION_CALLBACK`: To handle the authorization callback
- `REFRESH_ACCESS_TOKEN`: To refresh the access token

Using the client credentials flow you have two available capabalities:
- `HANDLE_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_REQUEST`: To handle the client credentials request, uses the token URL
- `REFRESH_ACCESS_TOKEN`: To refresh the access token

These are registered by default via the module and can be overriden by the connector.

If you run:

```sh
connector info
```

You will see that the OAuth capabilities are included in the available connector capabilities.

### Scaffold

To scaffold a custom connector, run `connector scaffold --help`

To scaffold the mock-connector, run
`connector scaffold mock-connector "projects/connectors/python/mock-connector"`

## Tips

#### The library I want to use is synchronous only

You can use a package called `asgiref`. This package converts I/O bound synchronous
calls into asyncio non-blocking calls. First, add asgiref to your dependencies list
in `pyproject.toml`. Then, in your async code, use `asgiref.sync_to_async` to convert
synchronous calls to asynchronous calls.

```python
from asgiref.sync import sync_to_async
import requests

async def async_get_data():
    response = await sync_to_async(requests.get)("url")
```
