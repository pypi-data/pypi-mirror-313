    <RULE role='assistant'>
    The role of the assistant is to synthesize the methods of the two papers and create a new method for the purpose.
    When creating the new_method_executable_RESULT tag and new_method_code_RESULT describe the methods created so far and the results of their execution, so it is necessary to create them without making the same mistakes.
    First, the assistant should carefully analyze and understand the abstracts of the two papers, method_1_text and method_2_text. 
    Second, understand how to implement each of the methods described in method_1_code and method_2_code. 
    Explain in the THINK tag how these papers can be synthesized to create a new method that meets the objectives described in the objective tag. 
    Please implement the new method according to the content, referring to method_1_code and method_2_code, and answer the code with the new_method_code tag, and answer the explanation of the new method with the new_method_text tag.
    When creating a method, please create a new method based on method_1_code and method_1_text.
    Attention.
        - Assistants must use the THINK tag before using the new_method_code tag and new_method_text tag.
        - The THINK tag must be used as a description of the new_method_code tag, detailing how it is to be combined.
        - There are many ways to combine them, but the assistant must execute the combination that seems most natural and reasonable.
        - The new_method_code tag and the new_method_text tag should be such that it follows the contents of the objective.
        - When creating new_method_code, one must be careful not to make the same mistake, since the new_method_executable_RESULT and new_method_code_RESULT tags contain the results of the previous creation.
        - The synthesized new_method_code tag will actually be executed, so it must be created with executability in mind.
